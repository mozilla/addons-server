# Contributing

If you're not sure this is the correct place to file an issue
then please file an issue on the [mozilla/addons] project instead.

Before contributing code, please note:

- You agree to license your contributions under the [license].
- Please ask on the [dev-addons mailing list] before submitting
  pull-requests for new features or large changes that are not related to
  existing issues.
- Follow [PEP8], [jshint] and our other [style guide conventions].
- Please write tests and read the docs on [addons-server].

Ready to get started? Follow [these steps](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Contribute/Code).

**Note to staff:** If you come across a potential "good first bug" for contributors, please tag it with "**maybe good first bug**". The community team [triages](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Contribute/Goodfirstbugs_triage) these every other week to ensure they have mentors assigned, onboarding information, and basic steps to get started. This gives new contributors a better experience when they pick a "good first bug" to work on.

Thank you for contributing!
