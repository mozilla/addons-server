Contributing
============

If you're not sure this is the correct place to file an issue
then please file an issue on the `mozilla/addons`_ project instead.

Before contributing code, please note:

-  You agree to license your contributions under the `license`_.
-  Please ask on the `dev-addons mailing list`_ before submitting
   pull-requests for new features or large changes that are not related to
   existing issues.
-  Follow `PEP8`_, `jshint`_ and our other `style guide conventions`_.
-  Please write tests and read the docs on `addons-server`_.

Ready to get started? Follow `these steps <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Contribute/Code>`_.

**Note to staff:** If you come across a potential "good first bug" for contributors, please tag it with "**maybe good first bug**". The community team `triages <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Contribute/Goodfirstbugs_triage>`_ these every other week to ensure they have mentors assigned, onboarding information, and basic steps to get started. This gives new contributors a better experience when they pick a "good first bug" to work on.

Thank you for contributing!
