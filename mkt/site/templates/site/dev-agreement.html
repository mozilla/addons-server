<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mozilla Corporation (&ldquo;Mozilla&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;) is committed to promoting choice and innovation on the web. &nbsp;That is why Mozilla created the &ldquo;Firefox Marketplace&rdquo; &ndash; a publicly available website allowing developers to distribute their (i) client applications (&ldquo;Apps&rdquo;) or (ii) extensions or themes that extend the functionality of the Firefox browser (&ldquo;Add-ons&rdquo;) (together, &ldquo;Marketplace Content&rdquo;) to users for use on their devices.</p>

<h2>Terms Governing Your Use of Firefox Marketplace</h2>
<p>As a developer, you are welcome to use the Firefox Marketplace to facilitate the distribution of your Marketplace Content. &nbsp;Your use of the Firefox Marketplace is subject to the terms and conditions of this Developer Agreement, the Firefox Marketplace <a href="{{ url('site.terms') }}">Terms of Use</a> as well as the related Firefox Marketplace Policies referred to in this agreement as well as posted in the Firefox Marketplace (collectively, the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;).</p>

<h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By indicating your acceptance below or otherwise using the Firefox Marketplace to distribute an App, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age, and have the full power, capacity, and authority to accept these Terms. If you are under 18 or do not have full power, capacity and authority to accept these Terms, then your parent or legal guardian needs to consent to your development of the Marketplace Content, agree to be bound by these Terms and interact with the Firefox Marketplace on your behalf. &nbsp;Regardless, you represent that you are over the age of 13, as the Firefox Marketplace is not available to users under the age of 13.</p>
<p>If you are submitting Marketplace Content on behalf of your employer or other entity you represent than you must have the authority to accept these Terms on behalf of your employer or such other entity that you represent. If you do not agree to these Terms or cannot make the foregoing representations, then you cannot use the Firefox Marketplace to distribute your Marketplace Content. &nbsp;As we innovate and introduce new features for the Firefox Marketplace, these Terms may need to change. &nbsp;We reserve the right to change these Terms in our sole discretion and if we do make changes, we will post a notice on the Firefox Marketplace describing the changes that were made, so make sure to check back periodically. &nbsp;If you have any questions about these Terms or the Firefox Marketplace, please {{ emaillink('app-reviewers@mozilla.org', 'email us') }}.</p>

<h2>Firefox Marketplace Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>You will be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of your registration for and use of the Firefox Marketplace as a Developer. You agree that any payment information provided to payment providers will always be accurate, correct and up to date. By using the Firefox Marketplace, you agree that Mozilla will use your information in conjunction with our operation of the Firefox Marketplace in accordance with the information handling practices in the Firefox Marketplace <a href="{{ url('site.privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Management of Firefox Marketplace</h2>
<p>You are the merchant of record for your Marketplace Content. Because we need to be able to manage the Firefox Marketplace (including preventing abuse), the inclusion and display of any Marketplace Content in the Firefox Marketplace is at Mozilla&rsquo;s sole discretion. While Mozilla is not obligated to review or test any Marketplace Content or its content, Mozilla or its community may at any time review or test any of your Marketplace Content for compliance with these Terms and any other applicable terms, obligations, laws, or regulations.</p>

<h2>Pricing and Transaction Fees</h2>
<p>You are the merchant of record for the sales of your Marketplace Content. As such, you may choose to distribute your Marketplace Content for free or for a fee and you are solely responsible for setting any price associated with the download of your App. If you want to charge a fee, you must have a valid payment account with a payment processor authorized by Mozilla. &nbsp;A &ldquo;payment account&rdquo; means an account issued by an authorized payment processor to you pursuant to a separate agreement between you and that payment processor, which authorizes the payment processor to collect and remit payments on the your behalf for Marketplace Content sold via the Firefox Marketplace.</p>
<p>We offer certain integrated payment processors for App purchases. If you charge a fee for your App and you use one of the integrated payment processors, then we will charge you a fee for each transaction. &nbsp;Our fees will be deducted by the payment processor out of the gross amounts collected for your App(s) or be separately payable by you to us. You can find our current fee schedule at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Marketplace_Payments">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Marketplace_Payments</a>. We reserve the right to modify the fees from time to time in our sole discretion.</p>

<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>Since you, not Mozilla, are selling your Marketplace Content as the merchant of record, you are solely responsible for determining whether charging a fee to a user for downloading an App is taxable and the applicable tax rate for the payment processor to collect for each taxing jurisdiction where the App is made available for download for a fee. &nbsp;You are solely responsible for remitting taxes to the appropriate taxing authority based on the transaction. For clarity, Mozilla does not have any tax obligations to you with respect to such Marketplace Content, including without limitation obligations to track and process payments, authenticate paid or previously paid downloads, maintain payment records, or pay, report, or charge sales, use or excise taxes. Please see Mozilla&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Marketplace_Payments/Tax_FAQ">Tax FAQ</a> for more information and make sure to consult your attorney or tax board to determine whether you need to collect and remit taxes.</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>The applicable payment processor&#39;s standard terms and conditions regarding refunds will apply to the purchases of Apps. Additionally, we require that you consent to certain minimum refund rules, as laid out in this section.</p>
<p>You authorize Mozilla to give the buyer a full refund of the Marketplace Content price on your behalf if the buyer requests the refund within 30 minutes after purchase. After that period, refund requests may be approved or rejected by you. You must respond to refund requests within 30 days of the request and refund requests that remain outstanding after 30 days may be sent to Mozilla by the buyer for our investigation.</p>
<p>As part of the Market enrollment process, you must authorize the applicable payment processor to allow Mozilla to grant refunds on your behalf. Mozilla may investigate abnormal volumes of refund requests for a particular piece of Marketplace Content to ensure its quality and listing accuracy.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for providing reasonable technical support to end users and you will make appropriate support contact information available (including by displaying it in each App&rsquo;s detail page) for customer support purposes. Failure to provide adequate support for your App(s) may result in low App ratings, less prominent App exposure, low sales, billing disputes, and suspension or removal from the Firefox Marketplace.</p>

<h2>Privacy-Related Obligations</h2>
<p>You agree to provide end users with a legally adequate privacy notice that accurately describes any collection, use or disclosure of information provided by end users. All Apps are required to have a privacy policy. Add-ons are required to have a privacy policy if any information about the user or usage of an Add-on is collected or transmitted outside of the user&rsquo;s device on which the Add-on is installed. You may only use user information for the purpose and in the manner authorized by the user and applicable law. &nbsp;You must have a data security and deletion policy that adequately protects your users by treating, storing, using and deleting information in accordance with your privacy policy and applicable laws. You will adhere to our privacy related guidelines and follow applicable industry best practices.</p>
<p>You will ensure that any advertising presented to end users of your Marketplace Content complies with all requirements of these Terms. For example, (i) embedded advertising and your use of data derived from such advertising must comply with our privacy-related requirements as well as applicable law; (ii) embedded advertising must comply with applicable laws and our policies; (iii) embedded advertising must not contain any &ldquo;spyware,&rdquo; &ldquo;malware&rdquo; or harmful code and must not cause injury to any person or damage to any property; and (iv) you must provide meaningful notice and have a procedure for end users to opt-out or opt-in (depending on applicable law and industry standards) to any tracking that leads to you or third parties tailoring advertisements or promotions to users.</p>

<h2>Marketing Your App in Firefox Marketplace</h2>
<p>You are responsible for uploading your Marketplace Content to the Firefox Marketplace, providing accurate Marketplace Content product and service information to users regarding the features and functionality of your Marketplace Content, and accurately disclosing the security permissions and user data necessary for the Marketplace Content to function on user devices. If any product or service information is inaccurate or needs to be updated or modified, you will promptly make such updates or modifications. &nbsp;Your Marketplace Content shall not imply in any way that it is produced or endorsed by Mozilla, unless you&rsquo;ve received prior written approval from Mozilla.</p>

<h2>Content Restrictions</h2>
<p>Any Marketplace Content you distribute in the Firefox Marketplace must adhere to Mozilla&rsquo;s content and other policies for developers. You can find our current policies here: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Marketplace_Review">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Marketplace_Review</a>.</p>

<h2>Persona</h2>
<p>Certain Marketplace Content uses Persona for authentication. We will provide you with receipts for purchases of your Marketplace Content by users. You represent and warrant that any information you are provided from Mozilla about users will be used solely in accordance with a user&rsquo;s consent and your privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Firefox Sync Add-ons</h2>
<p>If your App or Add-on utilizes any Firefox Sync APIs or software, you agree (a) that you and your App or Add-on will use the Firefox Sync API solely for its intended purpose; (b) that your App or Add-on will not hide or mask its identity as it uses Mozilla&rsquo;s hosted Firefox Sync services and/or Firefox Sync APIs, including by failing to follow required identification conventions; and (c) that you and your Apps or Add-ons will not use the Firefox Sync APIs for any application or service that replicates or attempts to replicate Mozilla&rsquo;s hosted Firefox Sync services or experience unless such use is non-confusing.</p>

<h2>App Ratings &amp; Statistics</h2>
<p>Firefox Marketplace allows end users who install Marketplace Content to rate that Marketplace Content and provide commentary. Mozilla may provide aggregate statistics regarding Marketplace Content usage to the developer of Marketplace Content, including but not limited to: ratings, number of daily, weekly, and monthly installs, downloads, active daily users, and revenue. This information may be used to determine the placement of Marketplace Content in the Firefox Marketplace and may be displayed publicly in the Firefox Marketplace and through our APIs. While we use information about your Marketplace Content to provide and promote the Marketplace Content and Firefox Marketplace, certain features of the Firefox Marketplace allow you to keep some of the raw Marketplace Content statistics private against other developers and users.</p>

<h2>Withdrawals, Takedowns and Termination</h2>
<h3>Removal by You</h3>
<p>You may remove any of your Marketplace Content from future distribution via the Firefox Marketplace at any time, but you must comply with these Terms and any applicable terms in your agreement with the payment processor including but not limited to refund requirements. Removing Marketplace Content from future distribution via the Firefox Marketplace does not (a) affect the license rights of users who have previously purchased or downloaded the Marketplace Content, (b) remove your Marketplace Content from user machines, hardware, or other devices, or from any part of the Firefox Marketplace where previously downloaded applications are stored on behalf of users (if any), or (c) change your obligation to deliver or support such Marketplace Content or services that have been previously purchased or downloaded by users. Mozilla will not maintain on any portion of the Firefox Marketplace any Marketplace Content that you have removed from the Firefox Marketplace and provided written notice to Mozilla that such removal was due to (i) an allegation of infringement, or actual infringement, of any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person, (ii) an allegation of defamation or actual defamation, (iii) an allegation of violation, or actual violation, of any third party&#39;s right of publicity or privacy, or (iv) an allegation or determination that such Marketplace Content does not comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>If you remove Marketplace Content from the Firefox Marketplace pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the preceding paragraph, at Mozilla&#39;s request, you will refund to each end user who purchased such Marketplace Content in the 365 days preceding the date of takedown, the amount paid by such end user for such affected Marketplace Content, less the transaction fee specifically allocated to the credit card/payment processing for the associated transaction.</p>
<p>If you remove all your Marketplace Content from the Firefox Marketplace, you may terminate these Terms by providing Mozilla with 30 days prior written notice of such termination. All of your obligations under these Terms related to your Marketplace Content shall survive any termination of these Terms, including your obligation with respect to outstanding refunds, any representations and warranties as well as indemnification to Mozilla.</p>
<h3>Mozilla Takedowns</h3>
<p>Mozilla has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Mozilla&rsquo;s sole discretion, remove any content that, in Mozilla&rsquo;s reasonable opinion, violates any Mozilla policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, if Mozilla is notified by you or otherwise becomes aware and determines in its sole and reasonable discretion that any Marketplace Content or any portion thereof (including without limitation any trademark, logo or other brand feature associated with such Marketplace Content): (a) violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone; (b) violates applicable law or is subject to an injunction; (c) violates Mozilla&rsquo;s Content Policy or other posted policy; (d) is being distributed by you improperly; (e) may create liability for Mozilla or anyone else; (f) is deemed by Mozilla to have a virus or be malware, spyware or have an adverse impact on Mozilla&rsquo;s or anyone else&rsquo;s networks or computers; or (g) violates these Terms, Mozilla may prevent the Marketplace Content from being made available in the Firefox Marketplace, remove the Marketplace Content from the Firefox Marketplace, &nbsp;flag, filter, modify related materials (including but not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or metadata), reclassify the Marketplace Content, or take other corrective action, at its sole discretion. If you have any questions or concerns regarding a removal, you may contact us at app-reviews@mozilla.org.</p>
<p>Mozilla may at any time suspend or terminate these Terms with you if Mozilla is no longer going to provide the Firefox Marketplace or Mozilla believes you have violated any policies or breached these Terms.</p>
