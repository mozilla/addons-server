          The Firefox OS Simulator add-on is a tool that enables you to test and
          debug your app on the desktop. The code-test-debug cycle is much
          faster with the simulator than with a real device, and of course, you
          don't need a real device in order to use it.

        The Simulator is packaged and distributed as a Firefox add-on. To install it:<br />
        <br />
        1. Using Firefox, go to the appropriate link for your host operating system. You'll probably have to tell Firefox to allow the site to install software:

        3. Once the add-on has downloaded you will be prompted to install it: click "Install Now".<br />
        <br />
        Because of the size of the add-on, Firefox may freeze for several
        seconds while installing it, and a dialog titled "Warning: Unresponsive
        script" may appear. It it does, click "Continue" to wait for
        installation to finish. This issue is being tracked as
        <a href="{{ bug_814505 }}">bug 814505</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Once you have installed the Simulator add-on, Firefox will periodically
        check for newer versions and keep it up to date for you.
