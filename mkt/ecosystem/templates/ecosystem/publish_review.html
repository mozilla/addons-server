          This article describes the set of requirements an app must meet to
          be distributed via the Firefox Marketplace. These requirements are
          designed to balance the needs of both developers and users of apps
          from the Firefox OS Marketplace. Developers want fair, consistent,
          non-draconian requirements that they can trust to build a business
          on. On the other hand, users want assurance that apps are safe,
          will work on their device, and that the app will do what it says
          it'll do. The app requirements below aim for the delicate balance
          between these needs.

          Here are Mozilla's expectations of what app review is and is not:
        {% endtrans -%}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {%- trans %}
            Criteria will be applied in a fair, compassionate, and consistent
            manner. The app review process is not intended to be a
            gatekeeper, but rather a trusted touch point that provides
            feedback to help developers be more successful.
          {% endtrans -%}
        </li>
        <li>
          {%- trans %}
            Reviewers are not a QA team! During the review process, someone
            will look over the app manifest and spend a few minutes
            exercising the application as a normal user would.
          {% endtrans -%}
        </li>
        <li>
          {%- trans %}
            If an app fails review, the developer will be given a clear
            explanation of the problems found, steps to reproduce, and where
            possible, the reviewer should point the developer in the right
            direction by providing links to relevant supporting documentation
            or make recommendations on what changes need to be made.
          {% endtrans -%}
        </li>
        <li>
          {%- trans %}
            Reviewers make no judgment on how an app <em>looks</em>, only on
            how the app <em>works</em>. For example, an app with a paragraph
            of red text on an orange background wouldn't be rejected because
            it's ugly, but might be rejected if it's not readable.
          {% endtrans -%}
        </li>
        <li>
          {%- trans %}
            We always give developers the benefit of the doubt. If unsure
            whether an app should be rejected, reviewers will ask questions
            <em>before</em> issuing a rejection. Apps will not be (knowingly)
            rejected due to platform issues that are outside of the
            developer's control; however we may withhold approval if we
            can't get the app to work.

            review team for clarification, even if the app isn't yet
            ready to be submitted. We want to help you stay on the right
            track, rather than invest development time into content that
            will be rejected.

            The developer must make a reasonable attempt to optimize app
            layout for the target platform. The intent of this requirement is
            to catch obvious failures, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>
                An app submitted for mobile that's obviously a desktop site.
              </li>
              <li>
                An app that very obviously doesn't stretch to fill available
                screen space (imagine a 320x480 app that only takes up the
                top corner on a tablet, with the rest of the screen blank.
                This is surely not intended!)

          found to violate any security, privacy, or content requirements,
          or apps that seriously degrade system or network performance.

          specific evidence otherwise, and will receive full assistance

          the problem resolved. Specific examples of situations where
