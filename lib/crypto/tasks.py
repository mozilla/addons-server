MAIL_MESSAGE = u"""
Your add-on, {addon}, has been automatically signed for distribution in
upcoming versions of Firefox. The signing process involved repackaging the
add-on files and adding the string '.1-signed' to their versions numbers. The
new versions have kept their review status and are now available for your
users.
We recommend that you give them a try to make sure they don't have any
unexpected problems: {addon_url}

If you are unfamiliar with the extension signing requirement, please read the
following documents:

Your add-on, {addon}, was automatically signed for distribution in upcoming

Firefox, and had to revert this signature. We restored the backups we had for
the signed versions.

unexpected problems: {addon_url}

Your add-on, {addon}, has been automatically resigned for distribution in

This has been done following an issue on our servers: the files that got
reviewed between 2015-11-10 and 2015-11-18 were signed incorrectly, which can
lead to installation problems. We strongly recommend that you use the newly
signed versions and distribute them to your users.
