# Translating Fields on Models

The `olympia.translations` app defines a
`olympia.translations.models.Translation` model, but for the most part, you
shouldn't have to use that directly. When you want to create a foreign key to
the `translations` table, use
`olympia.translations.fields.TranslatedField`. This subclasses Django's
`django.db.models.ForeignKey` to make it work with our special handling
of translation rows.

A minimal model with translations in addons-server would look like this:

```python
from django.db import models

from olympia.amo.models import ModelBase
from olympia.translations.fields import TranslatedField, save_signal

class MyModel(ModelBase):
    description = TranslatedField()

models.signals.pre_save.connect(save_signal,
                                sender=MyModel,
                                dispatch_uid='mymodel_translations')
```

## How it works behind the scenes

As mentioned above, a `TranslatedField` is actually a `ForeignKey` to the
`translations` table. However, to support multiple languages, we use a
special feature of MySQL allowing you to have a `ForeignKey` pointing to
multiple rows.

### When querying

Our base manager has a `_with_translations()` method that is automatically
called when you instanciate a queryset. It does 2 things:

- Stick an extra lang=lang in the query to prevent query caching from returning
  objects in the wrong language
- Call `olympia.translations.transformers.get_trans()` which does the black
  magic.

`get_trans()` is called, and calls in turn
`olympia.translations.transformer.build_query()` and builds a custom SQL
query. This query is the heart of the magic. For each field, it setups a join
on the translations table, trying to find a translation in the current language
(using `olympia.translation.get_language()`) and then in the language
returned by `get_fallback()` on the instance (for addons, that's
`default_locale`; if the `get_fallback()` method doesn't exist, it will
use `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`, which should be `en-US` in addons-server).

Only those 2 languages are considered, and a double join + `IF` / `ELSE` is
done every time, for each field.

This query is then ran on the slave (`get_trans()` gets a cursor using
`connections[multidb.get_replica()]`) to fetch the translations, and some
Translation objects are instantiated from the results and set on the
instance(s) of the original query.

To complete the mechanism, `TranslationDescriptor.__get__` returns the
`Translation`, and `Translations.__unicode__` returns the translated string
as you'd expect, making the whole thing transparent.

### When setting

Everytime you set a translated field to a string value,
`TranslationDescriptor_ ___set__` method is called. It determines which
method to call (because you can also assign a dict with multiple translations
in multiple languages at the same time). In this case, it calls
`translation_from_string()` method, still on the "hidden"
`TranslationDescriptor` instance. The current language is passed at this
point, using `olympia.translation_utils.get_language()`.

From there, `translation_from_string()` figures out whether it's a new
translation of a field we had no translation for, a new translation of a
field we already had but in a new language, or an update to an existing
translation.

It instantiates a new `Translation` object with the correct values if
necessary, or just updates the correct one. It then places that object in a
queue of Translation instances to be saved later.

When you eventually call `obj.save()`, the `pre_save` signal is sent. If
you followed the example above, that means
`olympia.translations.fields.save_signal` is then called, and it unqueues all
Translation objects and saves them. It's important to do this on `pre_save`
to prevent foreign key constraint errors.

### When deleting

Deleting all translations for a field is done using
`olympia.translations.models.delete_translation()`. It sets the field to
`NULL` and then deletes all the attached translations.

Deleting a _specific_ translation (like a translation in spanish, but keeping
the english one intact) is implemented but not recommended at the moment.
The reason why is twofold:

1. MySQL doesn't let you delete something that still has a FK pointing to it,
   even if there are other rows that match the FK. When you call `delete()`
   on a translation, if it was the last translation for that field, we set the
   FK to `NULL` and delete the translation normally. However, if there were
   any other translations, instead we temporarily disable the constraints to
   let you delete just the one you want.
2. Remember how fetching works? If you deleted a translation that is part of
   the fallback, then when you fetch that object, depending on your locale
   you'll get an empty string for that field, even if there are `Translation`
   objects in other languages available!

### Ordering by a translated field

`olympia.translations.query.order_by_translation` allows you to order a
`QuerySet` by a translated field, honoring the current and fallback locales
like it's done when querying.
