# Github Actions

The **addons-server** project uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and building processes in the CI environment.
The CI pipeline broken into workflows, jobs and steps that run on containers in github's cloud environment.
All workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Overview

Hereâ€™s an overview of the existing CI workflows and their architecture:

Workflows are run on events. Events determine the reason for running the workflow.
A workflow can be triggered by multiple events. {ref}`Learn more <configuration>` about configuring events below.

Generally, we run addons-server inside it's own docker container. This means every workflow generally follows the same pattern.

### Build the docker image

Run {ref}`_build.yml <_build_yml>` to build the docker image from the current ref in github.
This job can be configured to your needs to build, push, and or upload the image to be used later.
The build passing is itself a good first step to test the code, and you can further test after the image is ready.

### Run the docker image

Define a job that uses the {ref}`run-docker <actions_run_docker>` reusable action. This action runs our docker compose
project in the CI container allowing you to exeucte the same commands you would run locally.
This is the foundation of nearly every test we have in CI.

## Configuration

- links to docs for github action configuration and event payloads and syntax
- reusable actions have a _ prefix
- prefer reusable workflows over actions

### Workflows

Workflows are the top level configuration object for github actions. Here is an example:

```yaml
name: Set a name

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - master

concurrency:
  group: <some group>
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  job1:
    ...
```

> Important: Always define the most specific event triggers possible
> and always set concurrency groups to prevent too many instances of a workflow running simultaneously

### Reusable Workflows

We use reusable workflows to enable calling one workflow from another.
This allows better encapsulation of a set of logic that might itself require multiple jobs, matrix jobs
or direct access to built in context like secrets. Otherwise they are conceptually similar to {ref}`reusable actions <reusable_actions>`.

(_build_yml)=
#### _build.yml

[link](../../../.github/workflows/_build.yml)

This workflow can be triggered by any other workflow or directly via the CLI or github UI.
It builds a docker image based on the current state of the code, setting the appropriate metadata
based on context.

(_test_yml)=
#### _test.yml

[link](../../../.github/workflows/_test.yml)

Our main testing workflow runs a suite of tests verifying the docker image and django code within are running as expected.

(_test_main_yml_)=
#### _test_main.yml

[link](../../../.github/workflows/_test_main.yml)

This workflow is a branch of our _test.yml workflow, running specifically the main pytest suite.
It is split to its own workflow because it runs via a matrix strategy and spins up a lot of jobs.

(reusable_actions)=
### Reusable Actions

Reusable actions are like reusable workflows but they do not run on their own runner,
but directly as a step in a given workflow runner container.

(actions_context)=
#### context

[link](../../../.github/actions/context/action.yml)

This action provides additional context based on the `github` context object. Most importantly it helps us determine
if we are running on a fork or if various meta events (releast_tag, release_master) match the current context.
These contextual values are relevent globally and should return the same values no matter where context is called,
so context runs as an action and accepts no inputs.

(actions_run_docker)=
#### run-docker

[link](../../../.github/actions/run-docker/action.yml)

The main action to run our docker compose project. This action is configurable to run a specified command, with specified services,
and even configurable compose file. Importantly this action will pull an image via the digest or version, and if it cannot find the image
will build it locally to run the current state of the codebase.

## Gotchas

- workflow_dispatch and workflow_call inputs should be identical

Best practice should be to define all _reusable workflows with both a `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call` event trigger.
The inputs for each should be identical. This allows testing and otherwise triggering reusable workflows directly or via
another workflow with the same parameters and expectations.

- github object contents depend on the event triggering the workflow

One of the reasons we have the {ref}`context action <actions_context>` is because the information embedded in the github
object depends on the event that triggered a workflow, making finding a certain piece of information depend on the 'context'.
Be careful using the github object directly as you must consider many edge cases. Consult the context action and potentially
introduce an important contextual value their so it can be made consistent across different contexts.

- github converts job/step/workflow outputs to string regardless of the underlying data type

Even if you define an input with a specific datatype, outputs for steps, jobs and reusable workflows are all converted to strings.
This is important when passing values from outputs to inputs as the data type might not actually be what you want or expect.

Use:

```yaml
uses: <action>
with:
  number: ${{ fromJSON(output.value) }}
```

to convert values back into numbers/booleans.

- secrets are not available for workflows running on forks.

Github actions prevents forks from accessing secrets, so workflows that use secrets should be configured to either
not rely on secrets or have fallback behaviour in place.

- use context action to define global context

Most global context should be defined in the {ref}`context <actions_context>` action instead of directly in workflows.

- prevent invalid workflow configurations

When reusable workflows are passed invalid outputs, github will silently fail the workflow, to prevent this you should always
check the outcome of reusable workflow calls.
