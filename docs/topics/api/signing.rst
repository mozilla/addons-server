Signing
=======

.. note:: This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`.

The following API endpoints help you get your add-on signed by Mozilla
so it can be installed into Firefox without error. See
`extension signing <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Addons/Extension_Signing>`_
for more details about Firefox's signing policy.

----------------
Client Libraries
----------------

The following libraries will make it easier to use the signing API:

* `sign-addon <https://github.com/mozilla/sign-addon/>`_, for general programattic use in
  `NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/>`_
* `web-ext sign <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Signing_your_WebExtension_for_distribution>`_,
  for developing `Web Extensions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions>`_

If you are using ``curl`` to interact with the API you should be sure to pass
the ``-g`` flag to skip "URL globbing" which won't interact well with add-on
Ids that have {} characters in them.


.. _upload-version:

-------------------
Uploading a version
-------------------

You can upload a new version for signing by issuing a ``PUT`` request
and including the contents of your add-on in the ``upload`` parameter
as multi-part formdata. This will create a pending version on the
add-on and will prevent future submissions to this version unless
validation or review fails.

If the upload succeeded then it will be submitted for
validation and you will be able to check its status.

.. http:put:: /api/v3/addons/[string:addon-id]/versions/[string:version]/

    **Request:**

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        curl "https://addons.mozilla.org/api/v3/addons/@my-addon/versions/1.0/"
            -g -XPUT --form "upload=@build/my-addon.xpi"
            -H "Authorization: JWT <jwt-token>"

    :param addon-id: The id for the add-on.
    :param version: The version of the add-on. A version ending with
        ``a``, ``alpha``, ``b``, or ``beta`` and an optional number is
        detected as beta. For example: ``2.0-beta1`` or ``1.2a``.
    :param channel: (optional) The version channel this version should uploaded
        to, which determines its visibility on the site. Can be either
        ``unlisted`` or ``listed``.  See note below.
    :form upload: The add-on file being uploaded.
    :reqheader Content-Type: multipart/form-data

    .. note::
        ``channel`` is only valid for new versions on existing add-ons -
        if the add-on is new the version will be created as ``unlisted``.  If
        the parameter isn't supplied then the channel of the most recent
        version (submitted either via this API or the website) will assumed.
        (e.g. if you submit a version as ``listed`` then the next version will
        be ``listed``, if you don't specify the channel).

    **Response:**

    The response body will be the same as the :ref:`version-status` response.

    :statuscode 201: new add-on and version created.
    :statuscode 202: new version created.
    :statuscode 400: an error occurred, check the `error` value in the JSON.
    :statuscode 401: authentication failed.
    :statuscode 403: you do not own this add-on.
    :statuscode 409: version already exists.


Uploading without an ID
-----------------------

.. note::
    This is only valid for `WebExtensions <https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions>`_.
    All other add-on types require an add-on ID and have to use the regular
    endpoint to :ref:`upload a version <upload-version>`.


.. http:post:: /api/v3/addons/

    **Request:**

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        curl "https://addons.mozilla.org/api/v3/addons/"
            -g -XPOST -F "upload=@build/my-addon.xpi" -F "version=1.0"
            -H "Authorization: JWT <jwt-token>"

    :form upload: The add-on file being uploaded.
    :form version: The version of the add-on. A version ending with
        ``a``, ``alpha``, ``b``, or ``beta`` and an optional number is
        detected as beta. For example: ``2.0-beta1`` or ``1.2a``.
    :reqheader Content-Type: multipart/form-data

    **Response:**

    The response body will be the same as the :ref:`version-status` response.

    :statuscode 201: new add-on and version created.
    :statuscode 202: new version created.
    :statuscode 400: an error occurred, check the `error` value in the JSON.
    :statuscode 401: authentication failed.
    :statuscode 403: you do not own this add-on.
    :statuscode 409: version already exists.

------------------
Creating an add-on
------------------

If this is the first time that your add-on's UUID has been seen then
the add-on will be created as an unlisted add-on when the version is
uploaded.

.. _`version-status`:

-----------------------------------
Checking the status of your upload
-----------------------------------

You can check the status of your upload by issuing a ``GET`` request.
There are a few things that will happen once a version is uploaded
and the status of those events is included in the response.

Once validation is completed (whether it passes or fails) then the
``processed`` property will be ``true``. You can check if validation
passed using the ``valid`` property and check the results with
``validation_results``.

If validation passed then your add-on will be submitted for review.
In the case of unlisted add-ons this will happen automatically.  If your add-on
is listed then it will be reviewed by a human and that will take a bit longer.
You can check the ``automated_signing`` property to see if signing will happen
automatically or after a manual review. Once review is complete then the
``reviewed`` property will be set and you can check the results with the
``passed_review`` property.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/addons/[string:addon-id]/versions/[string:version]/(uploads/[string:upload-pk]/)

    :param addon-id: the id for the add-on.
    :param version: the version of the add-on.
    :param upload-pk: (optional) the pk for a specific upload.

    **Response:**

.. _download-signed-file:

------------------------
Downloading signed files
------------------------

When checking on your :ref:`request to sign a version <version-status>`,
a successful response will give you an API URL to download the signed files.
This endpoint returns the actual file data for download.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/file/[int:file_id]/[string:base_filename]

    **Request:**

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        curl "https://addons.mozilla.org/api/v3/file/123/some-addon.xpi?src=api"
            -g -H "Authorization: JWT <jwt-token>"

    :param file_id: the primary key of the add-on file.
    :param base_filename:
        the base filename. This is just a convenience for
        clients so that they write meaningful file names to disk.

    **Response:**

    There are two possible responses:

    * Binary data containing the file
    * A header that redirects you to a mirror URL for the file.
      In this case, the initial response will include a
      ``SHA-256`` hash of the file in the header ``X-Target-Digest``.
      Clients should check that the final downloaded file matches
      this hash.

    :statuscode 200: request successful.
    :statuscode 302: file resides at a mirror URL
    :statuscode 401: authentication failed.
    :statuscode 404: file does not exist or requester does not have
                     access to it.
