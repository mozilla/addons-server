List reviews
------------

.. review-list:

This endpoint allows you to fetch reviews for a given add-on or user. Either
``addon`` or ``user`` query parameters are required, and they can be
combined together.

When ``addon``, ``user`` and ``version`` are passed on the same request,
``page_size`` will automatically be set to ``1``, since an user can only post
one review per version of a given add-on. This can be useful to find out if a
user has already posted a review for the current version of an add-on.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/reviews/review/

    :query string addon: The :ref:`add-on <addon-detail>` id, slug, or guid to fetch reviews from. When passed, the reviews shown will always be the latest posted by each user on this particular add-on (which means there should only be one review per user in the results), unless the ``version`` parameter is also passed.
    :query string filter: The :ref:`filter(s) <review-filtering-param>` to apply.
    :query string user: The user id to fetch reviews from.
    :query boolean show_grouped_ratings: Whether or not to show ratings aggregates for this add-on in the response (Use "true"/"1" as truthy values, "0"/"false" as falsy ones).
    :query string version: The version id to fetch reviews from.
    :query int page: 1-based page number. Defaults to 1.
    :query int page_size: Maximum number of results to return for the requested page. Defaults to 25.
    :>json int count: The number of results for this query.
    :>json string next: The URL of the next page of results.
    :>json string previous: The URL of the previous page of results.
    :>json array results: An array of :ref:`reviews <review-detail-object>`.
    :>json object grouped_ratings: Only present if ``show_grouped_ratings`` query parameter is present. An object with 5 key-value pairs, the keys representing each possible rating (Though a number, it has to be converted to a string because of the JSON formatting) and the values being the number of times the corresponding rating has been posted for this add-on, e.g. ``{"1": 4, "2": 8, "3": 15, "4": 16: "5": 23}``.

.. _review-filtering-param:

   By default, the review list API will only return not-deleted reviews, and
   include reviews without text. You can change that with the ``filter`` query
   parameter.  You can filter by multiple values, e.g. ``filter=with_deleted,without_empty_body,with_yours``

    ===================  ======================================================
                  Value  Description
    ===================  ======================================================
           with_deleted  Returns deleted reviews too.  This requires the
                         Addons:Edit permission.
     without_empty_body  Excludes reviews that only contain a rating, and no
                         textual content.
             with_yours  Used in combination `without_empty_body` to include
                         your own reviews, even if they have no text.
