add-ons, and can return disabled, unreviewer, unlisted or even deleted add-ons.

.. note::
    Requires authentication and `AdminTools::View` or `ReviewerAdminTools::View`
    permissions.

Internal Login JSON API
-----------------------

.. _internal-login-json-api:

The JSON API login flow is initiated by accessing the start endpoint which
will add an ``fxa_state`` to the user's session and redirect them to Firefox
Accounts. When the user finishes authenticating with Firefox Accounts they
will be redirected to the client application which can make a request to the
login endpoint to exchange the Firefox Accounts token and state for a JWT.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/internal/accounts/login/start/

    :param string to: A path to append to the state. The state will be returned
        from FxA as ``state:path``, the path will be URL safe base64 encoded.
    :status 302: Redirect user to Firefox Accounts.
