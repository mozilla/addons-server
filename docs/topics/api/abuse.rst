The following API endpoint covers abuse reporting

---------------------------------
Submitting an add-on abuse report
---------------------------------

.. _`addonabusereport-create`:

The following API endpoint allows an abuse report to be submitted for an Add-on,
either listed on https://addons.mozilla.org or not.
Authentication is not required, but is recommended so reports can be responded
to if necessary.

.. warning::

    Except for the ``message``, all strings have a maximum length of 255 characters
    and should be truncated by the client where necessary.

.. warning::

    For ``addon_install_method`` and ``addon_install_source`` specifically,
    if an unsupported value is sent, it will be silently changed to ``other``
    instead of raising a 400 error.

.. _abuse-addon_install_method-parameter:

 Accepted values for the ``addon_install_method`` parameter:

  .. note::

      This should match what is documented for ``addonsManager.install.extra_keys.method`` in `Firefox telemetry event definition <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml>`_ except that the values are normalized by being converted to lowercase with the ``:`` and ``-`` characters converted to ``_``. In addition, extra values are supported for backwards-compatibility purposes, since Firefox before version 70 merged source and method into the same value. If an unsupported value is sent for this parameter, it will be silently changed to special ``other`` instead of raising a 400 error.
