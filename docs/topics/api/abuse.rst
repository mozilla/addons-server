.. _`addonabusereport-create`:

The following API endpoint allows an abuse report to be submitted for an Add-on,

to if necessary.

.. warning::

    Except for the ``message``, all strings have a maximum length of 255 characters
    and should be truncated by the client where necessary.

    For ``addon_install_method`` and ``addon_install_source`` specifically,
    if an unsupported value is sent, it will be silently changed to ``other``
    instead of raising a 400 error.

In addition, extra values are supported for backwards-compatibility purposes, since Firefox before version 70 merged source and method into the same value. If an unsupported value is sent for this parameter, it will be silently changed to special ``other`` instead of raising a 400 error.
