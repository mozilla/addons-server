========
Overview
========

.. note::

    These APIs are not frozen and can change at any time without warning.
    See :ref:`the API versions available<api-versions-list>` for details
    if you need stability.

This describes the details of the requests and responses you can expect from
the `addons.mozilla.org <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/>`_ API.

--------
Requests
--------

All requests should be made with the header::

        Content-type: application/json

---------
Responses
---------

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Status Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some common API responses that you can expect to receive at times.

.. http:get:: /api/v4/...

    :statuscode 200: Success.
    :statuscode 201: Creation successful.
    :statuscode 202: The request has been accepted for processing.
        This usually means one or more asyncronous tasks is being executed in
        the background so results aren't immediately visible.
    :statuscode 204: Success (no content is returned).
    :statuscode 400: There was a problem with the parameters sent with this
        request.
    :statuscode 401: Authentication is required or failed.
    :statuscode 403: You are not permitted to perform this action.
    :statuscode 404: The requested resource could not be found.
    :statuscode 500: An unknown error occurred.
    :statuscode 503: The site is in maintenance mode at this current time and
        the operation can not be performed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bad Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When returning a ``HTTP 400 Bad Request`` response, the API will try to return
some information about the error(s) in the body of the response, as a JSON
object. The keys of that object indicate the field(s) that caused an error, and
for each, a list of messages will be provided (often only one message will be
present, but sometimes more). If the error is not attached to a specific field
the key ``non_field_errors`` will be used instead.

Example:

     .. code-block:: json

         {
             "username": ["This field is required."],
             "non_field_errors": ["Error not linked to a specific field."]
         }

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unauthorized and Permission Denied
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When returning ``HTTP 401 Unauthorized`` and ``HTTP 403 Permission Denied``
responses, the API will try to return some information about the error in the
body of the response, as a JSON object. A ``detail`` property will contain a
message explaining the error. In addition, in some cases, an optional ``code``
property will be present and will contain a constant corresponding to
specific problems to help clients address the situation programmatically. The
constants are as follows:

    ========================  =========================================================
                       Value  Description
    ========================  =========================================================
        ERROR_INVALID_HEADER  The ``Authorization`` header is invalid.
     ERROR_SIGNATURE_EXPIRED  The signature of the token indicates it has expired.
    ERROR_DECODING_SIGNATURE  The token was impossible to decode and probably invalid.
    ========================  =========================================================


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Maintainance Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When returning ``HTTP 503 Service Unavailable`` responses the API may be in
read-only mode. This means that for a short period of time we do not allow any
write requests, this includes ``POST``, ``PATCH``, ``PUT`` and ``DELETE`` requests.

In case we are in read-only mode, the following behavior can be observed:

  * ``GET`` requests behave normally
  * ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH``, and ``DELETE`` requests return 503 with a json response that contains a localized error message

The response when returning ``HTTP 503 Service Unavailable`` in case of read-only mode looks like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "error": "Some features are temporarily disabled while we perform websi…"
    }

In case we are not in read-only mode everything should be back working as normal.

.. _api-overview-pagination:

~~~~~~~~~~
Pagination
~~~~~~~~~~

By default, all endpoints returning a list of results are paginated.
The default number of items per page is 25 and clients can use the `page_size`
query parameter to change it to any value between 1 and 50. Exceptions to those
rules are possible but will be noted in the corresponding documentation for
affected endpoints.

The following properties will be available in paginated responses:

* *next*: the URL for the next page in the pagination.
* *previous*: the URL for the previous page in the pagination.
* *page_size*: The number of items per page in the pagination.
* *page_count*: The number of pages available in the pagination. It may be
  lower than `count / page_size` for elasticsearch based paginations that
  go beyond our `max_result_window` configuration.
* *count*: the total number of records.
* *results*: the array containing the results for this page.


.. _api-overview-translations:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Translated Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that can be translated by users (typically name, description) have a
special behaviour. They are returned as an object, by default, with languages as keys and
translations as values, and by default all languages are returned:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": {
            "en-US": "Games",
            "fr": "Jeux",
            "kn": "ಆಟಗಳು"
        }
    }

However, for performance, if you pass the ``lang`` parameter to a ``GET``
request, then only the most relevant translation (the specified language or the
fallback, depending on whether a translation is available in the requested
language) will be returned.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Default API behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In API version 3 or 4 the response, if the ``lang`` parameter is passed, is a single string.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "Games"
    }

This behaviour also applies to ``POST``, ``PATCH`` and ``PUT`` requests: you
can either submit an object containing several translations, or just a string.
If only a string is supplied, it will only be used to translate the field in
the current language.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
v5 API behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the experimental :ref:`v5 API <api-experimental-v5>` the response, if the ``lang`` parameter is passed,
is an object containing only that translation.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": {
            "en-US": "Games"
        }
    }

For ``POST``, ``PATCH`` and ``PUT`` requests you submit an object containing
translations for any languages needing to be updated/saved.  Any language not
in the object is not updated, but is not removed.

For example, if there were existing translations of::

"name": {"en-US": "Games", "fr": "Jeux","kn": "ಆಟಗಳು"}

and the following request was made:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": {
            "en-US": "Fun"
        }
    }

Then the resulting translations would be::

"name": {"en-US": "Fun", "fr": "Jeux","kn": "ಆಟಗಳು"}

To delete a translation, pass ``null`` as the value for that language.
(Note: this behavior is currently buggy/broken - see
https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/8816 for more details)


.. _api-overview-outgoing:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Outgoing Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``wrap_outgoing_links`` query parameter is present, any external links
returned for properties such as ``support_url`` or ``homepage`` will be wrapped
through ``outgoing.prod.mozaws.net``. Fields supporting some HTML, such as
add-on ``description``, always do this regardless of whether or not the query
parameter is present.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cross Origin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All APIs are available with `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing`_ unless otherwise
specified.


.. _`Cross-Origin Resource Sharing`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS


.. _api-versions-list:

------------
API Versions
------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default v4 API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All documentation here, unless otherwise specified, refers to the default `v4` APIs,
which are considered stable.
The request and responses are *NOT* frozen though, and can change at any time,
depending on the requirements of addons-frontend (the primary consumer).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Frozen v3 API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any consumer of the APIs that requires more stablity may consider using
the `v3` API instead, which is frozen.  No new API endpoints (so no new features)
will be added to `v3` and we aim to make no breaking changes.
Despite the aim, we can't guarantee 100% stability.
The `v3` API will be maintained for as long as Firefox ESR60 is supported by Mozilla,
i.e. at least October 23rd 2019.

The documentation for `v3` can be accessed at: :ref:`v3-api-index`


 .. _api-experimental-v5:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Experimental v5 API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The experimental `v5` API contains some additional changes/features which are
either unstable, in-progress, or currently unsupported by addons-frontend.
It will eventually become the new default API when the current default, `v4`,
is frozen and the stable `v3` deprecated.
Any reference to v5 specific behavior/properties/endpoints will be explicit in
these docs.
