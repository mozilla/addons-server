.. note::

    These APIs are not frozen and can change at any time without warning.
    See :ref:`the API versions available<api-versions-list>` for alternatives
    if you need stability.
    The only authentication method available at
    the moment is :ref:`the internal one<api-auth-internal>`.

---------
Subscribe
---------

This endpoint allows you to subscribe the current user to the notification
sent when a new listed version is submitted on a particular add-on.

    .. note::
        Requires authentication and the current user to have any
        reviewer-related permission.

.. http:post:: /api/v4/reviewers/addon/(int:addon_id)/subscribe/

-----------
Unsubscribe
-----------

This endpoint allows you to unsubscribe the current user to the notification
sent when a new listed version is submitted on a particular add-on.

    .. note::
        Requires authentication and the current user to have any
        reviewer-related permission.

.. http:post:: /api/v4/reviewers/addon/(int:addon_id)/unsubscribe/

-------
Disable
-------

This endpoint allows you to disable the public listing for an add-on.

    .. note::
       Requires authentication and the current user to have ``Reviews:Admin``
        permission.

.. http:post:: /api/v4/reviewers/addon/(int:addon_id)/disable/

------
Enable
------

This endpoint allows you to re-enable the public listing for an add-on. If the
add-on can't be public because it does not have public versions, it will
instead be changed to awaiting review or incomplete depending on the status
of its versions.

    .. note::
        Requires authentication and the current user to have ``Reviews:Admin``
        permission.

.. http:post:: /api/v4/reviewers/addon/(int:addon_id)/enable/


-----
Flags
-----

This endpoint allows you to manipulate various reviewer-specific flags on an
add-on.

    .. note::
       Requires authentication and the current user to have ``Reviews:Admin``
       permission.

.. http:patch:: /api/v4/reviewers/addon/(int:addon_id)/flags/

    :>json boolean auto_approval_disabled: Boolean indicating whether auto approval are disabled on an add-on or not. When it's ``true``, new versions for this add-on will make it appear in the regular reviewer queues instead of being auto-approved.
    :>json string|null pending_info_request: Deadline date for the pending info request as a string, or ``null``.
    :>json boolean needs_admin_code_review: Boolean indicating whether the add-on needs its code to be reviewed by an admin or not.
    :>json boolean needs_admin_content_review: Boolean indicating whether the add-on needs its content to be reviewed by an admin or not.


-------------
List Versions
-------------

This endpoint allows you to list versions that can be used either for :ref:`browsing <reviewers-versions-browse>` or diffing versions.

    .. note::
        Requires authentication and the current user to have ``ReviewerTools:View``
        permission for listed add-ons as well as ``Addons:ReviewUnlisted`` for
        unlisted add-ons. Additionally the current user can also be the owner
        of the add-on.

        This endpoint is not paginated as normal, and instead will return all
        results without obeying regular pagination parameters.


If the user doesn't have ``AddonsReviewUnlisted`` permissions only listed versions are shown. Otherwise it can contain mixed listed and unlisted versions.

.. http:get:: /api/v4/reviewers/addon/(int:addon_id)/versions/

    :>json int id: The version id.
    :>json string channel: The version channel, which determines its visibility on the site. Can be either ``unlisted`` or ``listed``.
    :>json string version: The version number string for the version.

.. _reviewers-versions-browse:

------
Browse
------

This endpoint allows you to browse through the contents of an Add-on version.

    .. note::
        Requires authentication and the current user to have ``ReviewerTools:View``
        permission for listed add-ons as well as ``Addons:ReviewUnlisted`` for
        unlisted add-ons. Additionally the current user can also be the owner
        of the add-on.

.. http:get:: /api/v4/reviewers/addon/(int:addon_id)/versions/(int:version_id)/

    Inherits most properties from :ref:`version detail <version-detail-object>` except ``files``.

    .. _reviewers-versions-browse-detail:

    :param file: The specific file in the XPI to retrieve. Defaults to manifest.json, install.rdf or package.json for Add-ons as well as the XML file for search engines.
    :>json string validation_url_json: The absolute url to the addons-linter validation report, rendered as JSON.
    :>json string validation_url: The absolute url to the addons-linter validation report, rendered as HTML.
    :>json boolean has_been_validated: ``True`` if the version has been validated through addons-linter.
    :>json object addon: A simplified :ref:`add-on <addon-detail-object>` object that contains only a few properties: ``id``, ``name``, ``icon_url`` and ``slug``.
    :>json object file: The file attached to this version. See :ref:`version detail -> files[] <version-detail-object>` for more details.
    :>json string file.content: Raw content of the requested file.
    :>json string file.selected_file: The selected file, either from the ``file`` parameter or the default (manifest.json, install.rdf or package.json for Add-ons as well as the XML file for search engines).

    :>json string files.entries[].mime_category: The mime type category of this file. Can be ``image``, ``directory``, ``text`` or ``binary``.
    :>json int file.entries[].size: The size in bytes.
    :>json string file.entries[].modified: The exact time of the commit, should be equivalent with ``created``.


-------
Compare
-------

This endpoint allows you to compare two Add-on versions with each other.

    .. note::
        Requires authentication and the current user to have ``ReviewerTools:View``
        permission for listed add-ons as well as ``Addons:ReviewUnlisted`` for
        unlisted add-ons. Additionally the current user can also be the owner
        of the add-on.

.. http:get:: /api/v4/reviewers/addon/(int:addon_id)/versions/(int:version_id)/compare_to/(int:version_id)/

    .. note::

        Contrary to what ``git diff`` does, this API renders a hunk full of unmodified lines for unmodified files.

    Inherits most properties from :ref:`browse detail <reviewers-versions-browse-detail>`, except that most of the `file.entries[]` properties
    and `file.download_url` can be `null` in case of a deleted file.

    Properties specific to this endpoint:

    :>json array file.entries[]: The complete file-tree of the extracted XPI.
    :>json string files.entries[].status: Status of this file, see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status#_short_format
    :>json int|null file.entries[].depth: Level of folder-tree depth, starting with 0.
    :>json string file.entries[].filename: The filename of the file.
    :>json string file.entries[].path: The absolute path (from the root of the XPI) of the file.
    :>json string|null file.entries[].sha256: SHA256 hash.
    :>json string|null file.entries[].mimetype: The determined mimetype of the file or ``application/octet-stream`` if none could be determined. Can be ``null`` in case of a deleted file.
    :>json string|null files.entries[].mime_category: The mime type category of this file. Can be ``image``, ``directory``, ``text`` or ``binary``.
    :>json int|null file.entries[].size: The size in bytes.
    :>json string|null file.entries[].modified: The exact time of the commit, should be equivalent with ``created``.
    :>json object|null diff: See the following output with inline comments for a complete description.

Can be ``null`` in case a comment belongs to the whole file and not to a specific line.
    :>json object version: Object holding the :ref:`version <reviewers-versions-browse-detail>`.
    :>json int user.id: The id for an author.
    :>json string user.name: The name for an author.

    :statuscode 403: The user doesn't have the permission to create a comment. This might happen (among other cases) when someone without permissions for unlisted versions tries to add a comment for an unlisted version (which shouldn't happen as the user doesn't see unlisted versions, but it's blocked here too).

    **Response**
        In case of successful creation, the response is a :ref:`draft comment object<reviewers-draft-comment-detail-object>`.
