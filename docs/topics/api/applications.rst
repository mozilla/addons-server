Applications Versions
---------------------

.. _applications-version:

This internal endpoint allows you to create applications versions to be
referenced in add-ons manifests. It requires :ref:`authentication<api-auth>`
and a special permission.

The currently available applications versions are listed on a dedicated page:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/pages/appversions/

When a valid request is made to this endpoint, AMO will create the requested
version if it didn't exist, and also attempt to create a corresponding minimum
and maximum versions. The minimum version will use the major number and minor
version from the requested version, and the maximum version will use the major
version and ``*``.

Versions that already exist will be skipped.

Examples:
    - A request to ``/api/v4/applications/firefox/42.0/`` will create versions
      ``42.0`` and ``42.*``.
    - A request to ``/api/v4/applications/firefox/42.0a1/`` will create versions
      ``42.0``, ``42.0a1``, and ``42.*``.
    - A request to ``/api/v4/applications/firefox/42.0.1/`` will create versions
      ``42.0`` and ``42.0.1``. ``42.*``.
