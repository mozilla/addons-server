------
Search
------

.. _addon-search:

This endpoint allows you to search through public add-ons.

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/search/

    :query string q: The search query. The maximum length allowed is 100 characters.
    :query string app: Filter by :ref:`add-on application <addon-detail-application>` availability.
    :query string appversion: Filter by application version compatibility. Pass the full version as a string, e.g. ``46.0``. Only valid when the ``app`` parameter is also present.
    :query string author: Filter by exact (listed) author username or user id. Multiple author usernames or ids can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case add-ons with at least one matching author are returned.
    :query string category: Filter by :ref:`category slug <category-list>`. ``app`` and ``type`` parameters need to be set, otherwise this parameter is ignored.
    :query string color: (Experimental) Filter by color in RGB hex format, trying to find themes that approximately match the specified color. Only works for static themes.
    :query string exclude_addons: Exclude add-ons by ``slug`` or ``id``. Multiple add-ons can be specified, separated by comma(s).
    :query string guid: Filter by exact add-on guid. Multiple guids can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case any add-ons matching any of the guids will be returned.  As guids are unique there should be at most one add-on result per guid specified. For usage with Firefox, instead of separating multiple guids by comma(s), a single guid can be passed in base64url format, prefixed by the ``rta:`` string.
    :query string lang: Activate translations in the specific language for that query. (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`)
    :query int page: 1-based page number. Defaults to 1.
    :query int page_size: Maximum number of results to return for the requested page. Defaults to 25.
    :query string promoted: Filter to add-ons in a specific :ref:`promoted category <addon-detail-promoted-category>`.  Can be combined with `app`.   Multiple promoted categories can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case any add-ons in any of the promotions will be returned.
    :query string ratings: Filter to add-ons that have average ratings of a :ref:`threshold value <addon-threshold-param>`.
    :query string sort: The sort parameter. The available parameters are documented in the :ref:`table below <addon-search-sort>`.
    :query string tag: Filter by exact tag name. Multiple tag names can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case add-ons containing *all* specified tags are returned. See :ref:`available tags <tag-list>`
    :query string type: Filter by :ref:`add-on type <addon-detail-type>`.  Multiple types can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case add-ons that are any of the matching types are returned.
    :query string users: Filter to add-ons that have average daily users of a :ref:`threshold value <addon-threshold-param>`.
    :>json int count: The number of results for this query.
    :>json string next: The URL of the next page of results.
    :>json string previous: The URL of the previous page of results.
    :>json array results: An array of :ref:`add-ons <addon-detail-object>`. As described below, the following fields are omitted for performance reasons: ``release_notes`` and ``license`` fields on ``current_version`` as well as ``picture_url`` from ``authors``. The special ``_score`` property is added to each add-on object, it contains a float value representing the relevancy of each add-on for the given query.

.. _addon-search-sort:

    Available sorting parameters:

    ==============  ==========================================================
         Parameter  Description
    ==============  ==========================================================
           created  Creation date, descending.
         downloads  Number of weekly downloads, descending.
           hotness  Hotness (average number of users progression), descending.
            random  Random ordering. Only available when no search query is
                    passed and when filtering to only return promoted add-ons.
            rating  Bayesian rating, descending.
       recommended  Promoted addons in the recommended category above
                    non-recommended add-ons. Only available combined with
                    another sort - ignored on its own.
                    Also ignored if combined with relevance as it already takes
                    into account recommended status.
         relevance  Search query relevance, descending.  Ignored without a
                    query.
           updated  Last updated date, descending.
             users  Average number of daily users, descending.
    ==============  ==========================================================

    The default behavior is to sort by relevance if a search query (``q``)
    is present; otherwise place recommended add-ons first, then non recommended
    add-ons, then sorted by average daily users, descending. (``sort=recommended,users``).
    This is the default on AMO dev server.

    You can combine multiple parameters by separating them with a comma.
    For instance, to sort search results by downloads and then by creation
    date, use ``sort=downloads,created``. The only exception is the ``random``
    sort parameter, which is only available alone.


.. _addon-threshold-param:

    Threshold style parameters allow queries against numeric values using comparison.

    The following is supported (examples for query parameter `foo`):
        * greater than ``foo__gt`` (example query: ?foo__gt=10.1)
        * less than ``foo__lt`` (example query: ?foo__lt=10.1)
        * greater than or equal to ``foo__gte`` (example query: ?foo__gte=10.1)
        * less than or equal to ``foo__lte`` (example query: ?foo__lte=10.1)
        * equal to ``foo`` (example query: ?foo=10.1)


------------
Autocomplete
------------

.. _addon-autocomplete:

Similar to :ref:`add-ons search endpoint <addon-search>` above, this endpoint
allows you to search through public add-ons. Because it's meant as a backend
for autocomplete though, there are a couple key differences:

  - No pagination is supported. There are no ``next``, ``prev`` or ``count``
    fields, and passing ``page_size`` or ``page`` has no effect, a maximum of 10
    results will be returned at all times.
  - Only a subset of fields are returned.
  - ``sort`` is not supported. Sort order is always ``relevance`` if ``q`` is
    provided, or the :ref:`search default <addon-search-sort>` otherwise.

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/autocomplete/

    :query string q: The search query.
    :query string app: Filter by :ref:`add-on application <addon-detail-application>` availability.
    :query string appversion: Filter by application version compatibility. Pass the full version as a string, e.g. ``46.0``. Only valid when the ``app`` parameter is also present.
    :query string author: Filter by exact (listed) author username. Multiple author names can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case add-ons with at least one matching author are returned.
    :query string category: Filter by :ref:`category slug <category-list>`. ``app`` and ``type`` parameters need to be set, otherwise this parameter is ignored.
    :query string lang: Activate translations in the specific language for that query. (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`)
    :query string tag: Filter by exact tag name. Multiple tag names can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case add-ons containing *all* specified tags are returned. See :ref:`available tags <tag-list>`
    :query string type: Filter by :ref:`add-on type <addon-detail-type>`.
    :>json array results: An array of :ref:`add-ons <addon-detail-object>`. Only the ``id``, ``icon_url``, ``icons``, ``name``, ``promoted``, ``type`` and ``url`` fields are supported though.


------
Detail
------

.. _addon-detail:

This endpoint allows you to fetch a specific add-on by id, slug or guid.

    .. note::
        Non-public add-ons and add-ons with only unlisted versions require both
        authentication and reviewer permissions or an account listed as a
        developer of the add-on.

        A 401 or 403 error response will be returned when clients don't meet
        those requirements. Those responses will contain the following
        properties:

            * ``detail``: string containing a message about the error.
            * ``is_disabled_by_developer``: boolean set to ``true`` when the add-on has been voluntarily disabled by its developer.
            * ``is_disabled_by_mozilla``: boolean set to ``true`` when the add-on has been disabled by Mozilla.

Create
------

.. _addon-create:

This endpoint allows a submission of an upload to create a new add-on and setting other AMO metadata.

To create an add-on with a listed version from an upload (an :ref:`upload <upload-create>`
that has channel == ``listed``) certain metadata must be defined - a version ``license``, an
add-on ``name``, an add-on ``summary``, and add-on categories for each app the version
is compatible with.

    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`.

.. http:post:: /api/v5/addons/addon/

    .. _addon-create-request:

    :<json object categories: Object holding the categories the add-on belongs to.

.. _addon-edit:

This endpoint allows an add-on's AMO metadata to be edited.

    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`, and for the user to be an author of the add-on.

.. http:patch:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:id|string:slug|string:guid)/

~~~~~~~~~~
Addon Icon
~~~~~~~~~~

.. _addon-icon:

A single add-on icon used on AMO can be uploaded to ``icon``,
where it will be resized as 32, 64, and 128 pixels wide icons as ``icons``.
The resizing is carried out asynchronously  so the urls in the response may not be available immediately.
The image must be square, in either JPEG or PNG format, and we recommend 128x128.

The upload must be sent as multipart form-data rather than JSON.
If desired, some other properties can be set/updated at the same time as ``icon``, but fields that contain complex data structure (list or object) can not, so separate API calls are needed.

Note: as form-data can not include objects, and creating an add-on requires the version to be specified as an object, it's not possible to set ``icons`` during an :ref:`Add-on create <addon-create>`.


.. http:patch:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:addon_id|string:addon_slug|string:addon_guid)/

    .. _addon-icon-request-edit:

    :form icon: The icon file being uploaded, or an empty value to clear.
    :reqheader Content-Type: multipart/form-data


--------------------
Put - Create or Edit
--------------------

.. _addon-put:

This endpoint allows a submission of an upload, which will either update an existing add-on and create a new version if the guid already exists, or will create a new add-on if the guid does not exist.
See the :ref:`Add-on Create <addon-create>` documentation for details of the request and restrictions.

    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`, and for the user to be an author of the add-on if the add-on exists already.

    .. note::
        The guid in the url must match a guid specified in the manifest.

    .. note::
        A submission that results in a new add-on will have metadata defaults taken from the manifest (e.g. name), but a submission that updates an existing listing will not use data from the manifest.

.. http:put:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(string:guid)/


------
Delete
------

.. _addon-delete:

This endpoint allows an add-on to be deleted.
Because add-on deletion is an irreversible and destructive action an additional token must be retrieved beforehand, and passed as a parameter to the delete endpoint.
Deleting the add-on will permanently delete all versions and files submitted for this add-on, listed or not.
The add-on ID (``guid``) cannot be restored and will forever be unusable for submission.

    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`, and for the user to be an owner of the add-on..

.. http:delete:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:id|string:slug|string:guid)/

    .. _addon-delete-request:

    :query string delete_confirm: the confirmation token from the :ref:`delete confirm <addon-delete-confirm>` endpoint.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Delete Confirm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _addon-delete-confirm:

This endpoint just supplies a special signed token that can be used to confirm deletion of an add-on.
The token is valid for 60 seconds after it's been created, and is only valid for this specific add-on.


    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`, and for the user to be an owner of the add-on.

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:id|string:slug|string:guid)/delete_confirm/

    .. _addon-delete-confirm-request:

    :>json string delete_confirm: The confirmation token to be used with :ref:`add-on delete <addon-delete>` endpoint.


-------------
Versions List
-------------

.. _version-list:

This endpoint allows you to list all versions belonging to a specific add-on.

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:addon_id|string:addon_slug|string:addon_guid)/versions/

    .. note::
        Non-public add-ons and add-ons with only unlisted versions require both:

            * authentication
            * reviewer permissions or an account listed as a developer of the add-on

    :query string filter: The :ref:`filter <version-filtering-param>` to apply.
    :query string lang: Activate translations in the specific language for that query. (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`)
    :query int page: 1-based page number. Defaults to 1.
    :query int page_size: Maximum number of results to return for the requested page. Defaults to 25.
    :>json int count: The number of versions for this add-on.
    :>json string next: The URL of the next page of results.
    :>json string previous: The URL of the previous page of results.
    :>json array results: An array of :ref:`versions <version-detail-object>`.

.. _version-filtering-param:

   By default, the version list API will only return public versions
   (excluding versions that have incomplete, disabled, deleted, rejected or
   flagged for further review files) - you can change that with the ``filter``
   query parameter, which may require authentication and specific permissions
   depending on the value:

    ====================  =====================================================
                   Value  Description
    ====================  =====================================================
    all_without_unlisted  Show all listed versions attached to this add-on.
                          Requires either reviewer permissions or a user
                          account listed as a developer of the add-on.
       all_with_unlisted  Show all versions (including unlisted) attached to
                          this add-on. Requires either reviewer permissions or
                          a user account listed as a developer of the add-on.
        all_with_deleted  Show all versions attached to this add-on, including
                          deleted ones. Requires admin permissions.

Version Detail
--------------

.. _version-detail:

This endpoint allows you to fetch a single version belonging to a specific add-on.

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:addon_id|string:addon_slug|string:addon_guid)/versions/(int:id)/

--------------
Version Create
--------------

.. _version-create:

This endpoint allows a submission of an upload to an existing add-on to create a new version,
and setting other AMO metadata.

To create a listed version from an upload (an :ref:`upload <upload-create>` that
has channel == ``listed``) certain metadata must be defined - a version ``license``, an
add-on ``name``, an add-on ``summary``, and add-on categories for each app the version
is compatible with.  Add-on properties cannot be set with version create so an
:ref:`add-on update <addon-edit>` must be made beforehand if the properties are not
already defined.

    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`, and for the user to be an author of the add-on.

.. http:post:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:addon_id|string:addon_slug|string:addon_guid)/versions/

    .. _version-create-request:

    :<json string approval_notes: Information for Mozilla reviewers, for when the add-on is reviewed.  These notes are only visible to Mozilla.
    :<json object|array compatibility:
        Either an object detailing which :ref:`applications <addon-detail-application>`
        and versions the version is compatible with; or an array of :ref:`applications <addon-detail-application>`,
        where min/max versions from the manifest, or defaults, will be used.  See :ref:`examples <version-compatibility-examples>`.
    :<json string compatibility[app_name].max: Maximum version of the corresponding app the version is compatible with. Should only be enforced by clients if ``is_strict_compatibility_enabled`` is ``true``.
    :<json string compatibility[app_name].min: Minimum version of the corresponding app the version is compatible with.
    :<json string license: The :ref:`slug of a non-custom license <license-list>`. The license must match the add-on type. Either provide ``license`` or ``custom_license``, not both.  If neither are provided, and there was a license defined for the previous version, it will inherit the previous version's license.
    :<json object|null custom_license.name: The name of the license (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`). Custom licenses are not supported for themes.
    :<json object|null custom_license.text: The text of the license (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`). Custom licenses are not supported for themes.
    :<json object|null release_notes: The release notes for this version (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`).
    :<json string|null source: The submitted source for this version. As JSON this field can only be set to null, to clear it - see :ref:`uploading source <version-sources>` to set/update the source file.
    :<json string upload: The uuid for the xpi upload to create this version with.

Version compatibility examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _version-compatibility-examples:

    .. note::
        The compatibility for Dictionary type add-ons cannot be created or updated.

Full example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "compatibility": {
            "android": {
                "min": "58.0a1",
                "max": "73.0"
            },
            "firefox": {
                "min": "58.0a1",
                "max": "73.0"
            }
        }
    }

With some versions omitted:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "compatibility": {
            "android": {
                "min": "58.0a1"
                // "max" is undefined, so the manifest max or default will be used.
            },
            "firefox": {
                // the object is empty - both "min" and "max" are undefined so the manifest min/max
                // or defaults will be used.
            }
        }
    }

Shorthand, for when you only want to define compatible apps, but use the min/max versions from the manifest, or use all defaults:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "compatibility": [
            "android",
            "firefox"
        ]
    }


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _version-sources:

Version source files cannot be uploaded as JSON - the request must be sent as multipart form-data instead.
If desired, ``license`` can be set set/updated at the same time as ``source``, but fields that
contain complex data structure (list or object) such as ``compatibility``, ``release_notes``,
or ``custom_license`` can not, so separate API calls are needed.

Note: as form-data can not be nested as objects it's not possible to set ``source`` as part of the
``version`` object defined during an :ref:`Add-on create <addon-create>`.

.. http:post:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:addon_id|string:addon_slug|string:addon_guid)/versions/

    .. _version-sources-request-create:

    :form source: The add-on file being uploaded, or an empty value to clear.

    :<json object|array compatibility: Either an object detailing which :ref:`applications <addon-detail-application>` and versions the version is compatible with; or an array of :ref:`applications <addon-detail-application>`, where default min/max versions will be used if not already defined.  See :ref:`examples <version-compatibility-examples>`.
    :<json string compatibility[app_name].max: Maximum version of the corresponding app the version is compatible with. Should only be enforced by clients if ``is_strict_compatibility_enabled`` is ``true``.
    :<json string compatibility[app_name].min: Minimum version of the corresponding app the version is compatible with.

    :<json object|null release_notes: The release notes for this version (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`).
    :<json string|null source: The submitted source for this version. As JSON this field can only be set to null, to clear it - see :ref:`uploading source <version-sources>` to set/update the source file.


--------------
Version Delete
--------------

.. _version-delete:

This endpoint allows a version to be deleted.

    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`, and for the user to be an author of the add-on.

.. _addon-preview-create:

This endpoint allows a submission of a preview image to an existing non-theme add-on to create a new preview image. Themes can only have generated previews and new previews can not be created.
Image files cannot be uploaded as JSON - the request must be sent as multipart form-data instead.
If desired, ``position`` can be set set at the same time as ``image``, but ``caption`` can not, so a separate API call is needed.

    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`, and for the user to be an author of the add-on.

.. http:post:: /api/v5/addons/addon/(int:addon_id|string:addon_slug|string:addon_guid)/previews/

    .. _addon-preview-create-request:

    :form image: The image being uploaded.
    :form postion: Integer value for the position the image should be returned in the addon :ref:`detail <addon-detail-object>` (optional). Order is ascending so lower positions are placed earlier.
    :reqheader Content-Type: multipart/form-data

    .. _upload-create-request:

    :form upload: The add-on file being uploaded.
    :form channel: The channel this version should be uploaded to, which determines its visibility on the site. It can be either ``unlisted`` or ``listed``.
    :reqheader Content-Type: multipart/form-data


After the file has uploaded the :ref:`upload response <upload-detail-object>` will be
returned immediately, and the addon submitted for validation.
The :ref:`upload detail endpoint <upload-detail>` should be queried for validation status
to determine when/if the upload can be used to create an add-on/version.


-----------
Upload List
-----------

.. _upload-list:

This endpoint is for listing your previous uploads.

    .. note::
        This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`.

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/upload/

            * reviewer permissions or an account listed as a developer of the add-on

    :>json object|null eula: The text of the EULA, if present (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`).
    :>json object|null privacy_policy: The text of the Privacy Policy, if present (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`).


--------------
Language Tools
--------------

.. _addon-language-tools:

This endpoint allows you to list all public language tools add-ons available
on AMO.

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/language-tools/

    .. note::
        Because this endpoint is intended to be used to feed a page that
        displays all available language tools in a single page, it is not
        paginated as normal, and instead will return all results without
        obeying regular pagination parameters. The ordering is left undefined,
        it's up to the clients to re-order results as needed before displaying
        the add-ons to the end-users.

        In addition, the results can be cached for up to 24 hours, based on the
        full URL used in the request.

    :query string app: Mandatory when ``appversion`` is present, ignored otherwise. Filter by :ref:`add-on application <addon-detail-application>` availability.
    :query string appversion: Filter by application version compatibility. Pass the full version as a string, e.g. ``46.0``. Only valid when both the ``app`` and ``type`` parameters are also present, and only makes sense for Language Packs, since Dictionaries are always compatible with every application version.
    :query string author: Filter by exact (listed) author username. Multiple author names can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case add-ons with at least one matching author are returned.
    :query string lang: Activate translations in the specific language for that query. (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`)
    :query string type: Mandatory when ``appversion`` is present. Filter by :ref:`add-on type <addon-detail-type>`. The default is to return both Language Packs or Dictionaries.
    :>json array results: An array of language tools.
    :>json int results[].id: The add-on id on AMO.
    :>json object results[].current_compatible_version: Object holding the latest publicly available :ref:`version <version-detail-object>` of the add-on compatible with the ``appversion`` parameter used. Only present when ``appversion`` is passed and valid. For performance reasons, only the following version properties are returned on the object: ``id``, ``file``, ``reviewed``, and ``version``.
    :>json string results[].default_locale: The add-on default locale for translations.
    :>json object|null results[].name: The add-on name (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`).
    :>json string results[].guid: The add-on `extension identifier <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Install_Manifests#id>`_.
    :>json string results[].slug: The add-on slug.
    :>json string results[].target_locale: For dictionaries and language packs, the locale the add-on is meant for. Only present when using the Language Tools endpoint.
    :>json string results[].type: The :ref:`add-on type <addon-detail-type>`.
    :>json string results[].url: The (absolute) add-on detail URL.


-------------------
Replacement Add-ons
-------------------

.. _addon-replacement-addons:

This endpoint returns a list of suggested replacements for legacy add-ons that are unsupported in Firefox 57.  Added to support the TAAR recommendation service.

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/replacement-addon/

    :query int page: 1-based page number. Defaults to 1.
    :query int page_size: Maximum number of results to return for the requested page. Defaults to 25.
    :>json int count: The total number of replacements.
    :>json string next: The URL of the next page of results.
    :>json string previous: The URL of the previous page of results.
    :>json array results: An array of replacements matches.
    :>json string results[].guid: The extension identifier of the legacy add-on.
    :>json string results[].replacement[]: An array of guids for the replacements add-ons.  If there is a direct replacement this will be a list of one add-on guid.  The list can be empty if all the replacement add-ons are invalid (e.g. not publicly available on AMO).  The list will also be empty if the replacement is to a url that is not an addon or collection.


---------------
Recommendations
---------------

.. _addon-recommendations:

This endpoint provides recommendations of other addons to install, fetched from the `recommendation service <https://github.com/mozilla/taar>`_.
Four recommendations are fetched, but only valid, publicly available addons are shown (so max 4 will be returned, and possibly less).

.. http:get:: /api/v5/addons/recommendations/

    :query string app: Set the :ref:`add-on application <addon-detail-application>` for that query. This won't filter the results. Defaults to ``firefox``.
    :query string guid: Fetch recommendations for this add-on guid.

    :>json string outcome: Outcome of the response returned.  Will be either: ``recommended`` - responses from recommendation service; ``recommended_fallback`` - service timed out or returned empty or invalid results so we returned fallback; ``curated`` - ``recommended=False`` was requested so fallback returned.
    :>json string|null fallback_reason: if ``outcome`` was ``recommended_fallback`` then the reason why.  Will be either: ``timeout``, ``no_results``, or ``invalid_results``.
    :>json int count: The number of results for this query.
    :>json string next: The URL of the next page of results.
    :>json string previous: The URL of the previous page of results.
    :>json array results: An array of :ref:`add-ons <addon-detail-object>`. The following fields are omitted for performance reasons: ``release_notes`` and ``license`` fields on ``current_version`` and ``current_beta_version``, as well as ``picture_url`` from ``authors``.
