Add-ons
=======

.. note::

    These APIs are experimental and are currently being worked on. Endpoints
    may change without warning. The only authentication method available at
    the moment is :ref:`the internal one<api-auth-internal>`.

--------
Featured
--------

.. _addon-featured:

This endpoint allows you to list featured add-ons matching some parameters.
Results are sorted randomly and therefore, the standard pagination parameters
are not accepted. The query parameter ``page_size`` is allowed but only serves
to customize the number of results returned, clients can not request a specific
page.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/addons/featured/

    :query string app: **Required**. Filter by :ref:`add-on application <addon-detail-application>` availability.
    :query string category: Filter by :ref:`category slug <category-list>`. ``app`` and ``type`` parameters need to be set, otherwise this parameter is ignored.
    :query string lang: Request add-ons featured for this specific language to be returned alongside add-ons featured globally. Also activate translations for that query. (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`)
    :query string type: Filter by :ref:`add-on type <addon-detail-type>`.
    :query int page_size: Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to 25.
    :>json array results: An array of :ref:`add-ons <addon-detail-object>`.

------
Search
------

.. _addon-search:

This endpoint allows you to search through public add-ons.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/addons/search/

    :query string q: The search query. The maximum length allowed is 100 characters.
    :query string app: Filter by :ref:`add-on application <addon-detail-application>` availability.
    :query string appversion: Filter by application version compatibility. Pass the full version as a string, e.g. ``46.0``. Only valid when the ``app`` parameter is also present.
    :query string author: Filter by exact author username. Multiple author names can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case add-ons with at least one matching author are returned.
    :query string category: Filter by :ref:`category slug <category-list>`. ``app`` and ``type`` parameters need to be set, otherwise this parameter is ignored.
    :query string exclude_addons: Exclude add-ons by ``slug`` or ``id``. Multiple add-ons can be specified, separated by comma(s).
    :query boolean featured: Filter to only featured add-ons.  Only ``featured=true`` is supported.
        If ``app`` is provided as a parameter then only featured collections targeted to that application are taken into account.
        If ``lang`` is provided then only featured collections targeted to that language, (and collections for all languages), are taken into account. Both ``app`` and ``lang`` can be provided to filter to addons that are featured in collections that application and for that language, (and for all languages).
    :query string guid: Filter by exact add-on guid. Multiple guids can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case any add-ons matching any of the guids will be returned.  As guids are unique there should be at most one add-on result per guid specified.
    :query string lang: Activate translations in the specific language for that query. (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`)
    :query int page: 1-based page number. Defaults to 1.
    :query int page_size: Maximum number of results to return for the requested page. Defaults to 25.
    :query string platform: Filter by :ref:`add-on platform <addon-detail-platform>` availability.
    :query string tag: Filter by exact tag name. Multiple tag names can be specified, separated by comma(s), in which case add-ons containing *all* specified tags are returned.
    :query string type: Filter by :ref:`add-on type <addon-detail-type>`.
    :query string sort: The sort parameter. The available parameters are documented in the :ref:`table below <addon-search-sort>`.
    :>json int count: The number of results for this query.
    :>json string next: The URL of the next page of results.
    :>json string previous: The URL of the previous page of results.
    :>json array results: An array of :ref:`add-ons <addon-detail-object>`.

.. _addon-search-sort:

    Available sorting parameters:

    ==============  ==========================================================
         Parameter  Description
    ==============  ==========================================================
           created  Creation date, descending.
         downloads  Number of weekly downloads, descending.
           hotness  Hotness (average number of users progression), descending.
            random  Random ordering. Only available when no search query is
                    passed and when filtering to only return featured add-ons.
            rating  Bayesian rating, descending.
         relevance  Search query relevance, descending.
           updated  Last updated date, descending.
             users  Average number of daily users, descending.
    ==============  ==========================================================

    The default is to sort by relevance if a search query (``q``) is present,
    otherwise sort by number of weekly downloads, descending.

    You can combine multiple parameters by separating them with a comma.
    For instance, to sort search results by downloads and then by creation
    date, use ``sort=downloads,created``. The only exception is the ``random``
    sort parameter, which is only available alone.


------------
Autocomplete
------------

.. _addon-autocomplete:

Similar to :ref:`add-ons search endpoint <addon-search>` above, this endpoint
allows you to search through public add-ons. Because it's meant as a backend
for autocomplete though, there are a couple key differences:

  - No pagination is supported. There are no ``next``, ``prev`` or ``count``
    fields, and passing ``page_size`` or ``page`` has no effect, a maximum of 10
    results will be returned at all times.
  - Only a subset of fields are returned.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/addons/autocomplete/

    :query string q: The search query.
    :query string app: Filter by :ref:`add-on application <addon-detail-application>` availability.
    :query string appversion: Filter by application version compatibility. Pass the full version as a string, e.g. ``46.0``. Only valid when the ``app`` parameter is also present.
    :query string author: Filter by exact author username.
    :query string category: Filter by :ref:`category slug <category-list>`. ``app`` and ``type`` parameters need to be set, otherwise this parameter is ignored.
    :query string lang: Activate translations in the specific language for that query. (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`)
    :query string platform: Filter by :ref:`add-on platform <addon-detail-platform>` availability.
    :query string tag: Filter by exact tag name. Multiple tag names can be specified, separated by comma(s).
    :query string type: Filter by :ref:`add-on type <addon-detail-type>`.
    :query string sort: The sort parameter. The available parameters are documented in the :ref:`table below <addon-search-sort>`.
    :>json array results: An array of :ref:`add-ons <addon-detail-object>`. Only the ``id``, ``icon_url``, ``name`` and ``url`` fields are supported though.


------
Detail
------

.. _addon-detail:

This endpoint allows you to fetch a specific add-on by id, slug or guid.

    .. note::
        Non-public add-ons and add-ons with only unlisted versions require both
        authentication and reviewer permissions or an account listed as a
        developer of the add-on.

        A 401 or 403 error response will be returned when clients don't meet
        those requirements. Those responses will contain the following
        properties:

            * ``detail``: string containing a message about the error.
            * ``is_disabled_by_developer``: boolean set to ``true`` when the add-on has been voluntarily disabled by its developer.

Version Detail
--------------

.. _version-detail:

This endpoint allows you to fetch a single version belonging to a specific add-on.

.. _addon-feature-compatibility:

This endpoint allows you to fetch feature compatibility information for a
a specific add-on by id, slug or guid.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/addons/addon/(int:id|string:slug|string:guid)/feature_compatibility/

    .. note::
        Non-public add-ons and add-ons with only unlisted versions require both:

This endpoint allows you to list all public language tools add-ons available
on AMO.

.. http:get:: /api/v3/addons/language-tools/

    .. note::
        Because this endpoint is intended to be used to feed a page that
        displays all available language tools in a single page, it is not
        paginated as normal, and instead will return all results without
        obeying regular pagination parameters. The ordering is left undefined,
        it's up to the clients to re-order results as needed before displaying
        the add-ons to the end-users.

    :query string app: Mandatory. Filter by :ref:`add-on application <addon-detail-application>` availability.
    :query string lang: Activate translations in the specific language for that query. (See :ref:`translated fields <api-overview-translations>`)
