===================================
Welcome to Olympia's documentation!
===================================

Olympia is the codebase for https://addons.mozilla.org/ ;
the source lives at https://github.com/mozilla/olympia

If you want to build a completely different site with all the same Django
optimizations for security, scalability, L10n, and ease of use, check out
Mozilla's `Playdoh starter kit <http://playdoh.readthedocs.org/>`_.

.. _install-with-docker:

Quickstart
----------
Want the easiest way to start contributing to AMO? Try our docker-based
development environment.

First you'll need to install docker_, please check the information for
the installation steps specific to your operating system.

.. note::
    Docker recommends installing docker-toolbox_ if you're on OSX or
    windows and that will provide you with the ``docker-machine`` and
    ``docker-compose`` (mac-only).


.. _creating-the-docker-vm:

Creating the docker vm (mac/windows)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you go the docker-machine route your first step is to create a vm::

    docker-machine create --driver=virtualbox addons-dev

Then you can export the variables so that docker-compose can talk to
the docker service. This command will tell you how to do that::

    docker-machine env addons-dev

On a mac it's a case of running::

    eval $(docker-machine env addons-dev)

Setting up the containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next once you have docker up and running follow these steps
on your host machine::

    git clone git://github.com/mozilla/olympia.git
    cd olympia
    pip install docker-compose
    docker-compose pull  # Can take a while depending on your internet bandwidth.
    docker-compose up -d
    make initialize_docker  # Answer yes, and create your superuser when asked.

The last step is to grab the ip of the vm. If you're using docker-machine,
you can get the ip like so::

    docker-machine ip addons-dev

.. note::
    If you're still using boot2docker then the command is `boot2docker ip`.
    At this point you can look at installing docker-toolbox and migrating
    your old boot2docker vm across to running via docker-machine. See
    docker-toolbox_ for more info.

Now you can connect to port 80 of that ip address. Here's an example
(your ip might be different)::

    http://192.168.99.100/

.. note::
    Bear in mind docker-machine hands out ip addresses as each vm is started;
    so you might find this ip address changes over time. You can always find out
    what ip is being used with ``docker-machine ip [machine name]``


Any other commands can now be run in a shell on the running container::

    make shell

Then, to run the tests for example, just run this command in the shell::

    py.test

Any time you update Olympia (e.g., running ``git pull``), you should make sure to
update your Docker image and database with any new requirements or migrations::

    docker-compose stop
    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose up -d
    make update_docker  # Runs database migrations and rebuilds assets.

Please note that any command that would result in files added or modified
outside of the `olympia` folder (eg modifying pip or npm dependencies) won't be
persisted, and so won't survive after the container is finished.

.. note::
    If you need to persist any changes to the image, they should be carried out
    via the `Dockerfile`. Commits to master will result in the Dockerfile being
    rebuilt on the docker hub.

If you quit docker-machine, or restart your computer, docker-machine will need
to be started again using::

    docker-machine start addons-dev

You'll then need to :ref:`export the variables <creating-the-docker-vm>` again,
and start the services::

    docker-compose up -d

Hacking on the Docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to test out changes to the Olympia Docker image locally, use the
normal `Docker commands <https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/>`_
such as this to build a new image::

    cd olympia
    docker build -t addons/olympia .
    docker-compose up -d

After you've tested your new image, simply commit to master and the
image will be published to Docker Hub for other developers to use after
they pull image changes.


Full Installation (deprecated)
------------------------------
Using :ref:`Docker <install-with-docker>` is the recommended and
supported approach for running the development environment.

However, if you would rather install manually, follow
the :ref:`manual Olymia installation <installation>` instructions.

gettext in Javascript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have gettext in javascript!  Just mark your strings with ``gettext()`` or
``ngettext()``.  There isn't an ``_`` alias right now, since underscore.js has
that.  If we end up with a lot of js translations, we can fix that.  Check it
out::

    cd locale
    ./extract-po.py -d javascript
    pybabel init -l en_US -d . -i javascript.pot -D javascript
    perl -pi -e 's/fuzzy//' en_US/LC_MESSAGES/javascript.po
    pybabel compile -d . -D javascript
    open http://0/en-US/jsi18n/

Git Bisect
~~~~~~~~~~

Did you break something recently?  Are you wondering which commit started the
problem? ::

    git bisect start
    git bisect bad
    git bisect good <master>  # Put the known-good commit here.
    git bisect run fab test
    git bisect reset

Git will churn for a while, running tests, and will eventually tell you where
you suck.  See the git-bisect man page for more details.


Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run your tests like this::

    py.test

There's also a few useful makefile targets like ``test``, ``tdd`` and
``test_force_db``::

    make test

If you want to only run a few tests, you can specify which ones using different
methods:

* `py.test -m es_tests` to run the tests that are marked_ as `es_tests`
* `py.test -k test_no_license` to run all the tests that have
  `test_no_license` in their name
* `py.test apps/addons/tests/test_views.py::TestLicensePage::test_no_license`
  to run only this specific test

You'll find more documentation on this on the `Pytest usage documentation`_.

    http://pytest.org/latest/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests


Building Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To simply build the docs::

    make docs

If you're working on the docs, use ``make loop`` to keep your built pages
up-to-date::

    cd docs
    make loop


Indices and tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
