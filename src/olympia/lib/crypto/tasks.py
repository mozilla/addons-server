MAIL_COSE_SUBJECT = (
    u'Your Firefox extension has been re-signed with a stronger signature')

MAIL_COSE_MESSAGE = u'''
Hello,

Mozilla has recently upgraded the signing [1] for Firefox extensions, themes,
dictionaries, and langpacks to provide a stronger signature. All add-on
versions uploaded to addons.mozilla.org after April 5, 2019 have this
signature. We plan to stop accepting the old signature with Firefox 70 [2].

The current version of your add-on, {addon}, listed on addons.mozilla.org has
been automatically re-signed with the stronger signature. Your add-on will
remain backwards compatible with previous versions of Firefox, including ESR 68
[3], and will continue working when your users upgrade to Firefox 70.

You do not need to take any action at this time.

Regards,

The Add-ons Team

Firefox add-on. If you do not want to receive these updates regarding your
