MAIL_SUBJECT = u'Mozilla Add-ons: {addon} has been automatically signed on AMO'
MAIL_MESSAGE = u"""
Your add-on, {addon}, has been automatically signed for distribution in
upcoming versions of Firefox. The signing process involved re-packaging add-on
files and changing the version string to ensure automatic updates work
correctly. The new versions have kept their review status and are now available
for your users.

We recommend that you give them a try to make sure they don't have any
unexpected problems: {addon_url}

If you are unfamiliar with the extension signing requirement, please read the
following documents:

* Signing announcement:
  http://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/02/10/extension-signing-safer-experience/

* Documentation page and FAQ: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Addons/Extension_Signing

If you have any questions or comments on this, please reply to this email or
join #addon-reviewers on irc.mozilla.org.

MAIL_EXPIRY_SUBJECT = (
    u'Mozilla Add-ons: {addon} has been resigned on AMO')
MAIL_EXPIRY_MESSAGE = u"""
Your add-on, {addon}, has been automatically signed.

We recently discovered a problem with the expiration date of add-on signatures.
As a result, for the next few weeks Firefox will not be able to recognize the
signatures of some add-ons. We are contacting you because your add-on,
{addon}, is affected.

To address this problem, we're signing the affected add-ons again and letting
you know in case you need to deploy this update to your users. The details of
this issue can be found here:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1267318

This signing process involved re-packaging add-on files and adding the string
'.1-signed' to their version numbers. If the version number already ended in
'.1-signed', we will increment the number, for example '.1-signed-2'. The
current review status of your add-on will remain the same. Alternatively, you
can upload a new version and have it signed through the usual means.

If you have any questions or need support, please reply to this email or
join #addons on irc.mozilla.org and we'll do our best to help.
