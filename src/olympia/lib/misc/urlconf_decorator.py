"""
Apply a decorator to a whole urlconf instead of a single view function.

Usage::

    >>> from urlconf_decorator import decorate
    >>>
    >>> def dec(f):
    ...     def wrapper(*args, **kw):
    ...         print 'inside the decorator'
    ...         return f(*args, **kw)
    ...     return wrapper
    >>>
    >>> urlpatterns = patterns(''
    ...     url('^admin/', decorate(dec, include(admin.site.urls))),
    ... )

The decorator applied to the urlconf is a normal function decorator.  It gets
wrapped around each callback in the urlconf as if you had @decorator above the
function.
