{% load i18n %}{# L10n: This is an email. Whitespace matters #}{% blocktrans %}Dear add-on developer,

We noticed that your secret AMO API credentials were included in an add-on submitted to addons.mozilla.org. In order to protect your account and your add-on(s), we revoked the leaked credentials.
You can generate new API credentials at {{ api_keys_url }}

Please make sure you never share your credentials with anyone. Never include them in a public repository, add-on or any other public place. We encourage you to review your code repositories and your extensions to remove any references to your AMO credentials.

Thank you,
The Mozilla Add-ons team
