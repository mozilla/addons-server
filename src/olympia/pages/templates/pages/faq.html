        Add-ons are small pieces of software that add new features or
        functionality to your installation of {{ app_name }}. Add-ons can
        augment {{ app_name }} with new features, foreign language
        dictionaries, or change its visual appearance. Through add-ons, you can
        customize {{ app_name }} to meet your needs and tastes.

        Add-ons listed in this gallery only work with Mozilla-based
        applications, such as <a href="{{ getfirefox_url }}">Firefox</a>,
        <a href="{{ getmobile_url }}">Firefox for Android</a>,
        <a href="{{ getseamonkey_url }}">SeaMonkey</a>, and
        <a href="{{ getthunderbird_url }}">Thunderbird</a>. However, not all
        add-ons work with each of those applications or every version of those
        applications. Each add-on specifies which applications and versions it
        works with, such as Firefox 50.0 - 52.*. For Firefox add-ons, the
        install buttons will indicate whether the add-on is compatible or not.

        the Add-ons Manager in {{ app_name }}. For more detailed instructions,

        Use caution when installing add-ons, as they may harm your computer or
        violate your privacy. Add-ons available from this site may be subject to
        review by Mozilla's team of reviewers, and user feedback is closely
        monitored, so they should generally be safe to install.

    <dt>{% trans app_name=request.APP.pretty %}Can add-ons make
    {{ app_name }} slower?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>{% trans app_name=request.APP.pretty %}
        Most add-ons do not cause a perceivable performance decrease in
        {{ app_name }}, though installing an excessive number may have adverse
        effects. If you suspect an add-on is causing {{ app_name }} to be slow,
        try disabling it.{% endtrans %}</dd>

    <dd>{% trans app_name=request.APP.pretty,

        If an add-on isn't compatible with your version of {{ app_name }}, it
        is usually either because your version of {{ app_name }} is outdated
        or the add-on author has not yet updated the add-on to be compatible
        with a newer version you are using. Mozilla does not recommend trying
        to circumvent these compatibility checks, as they can lead to browser
        instability or in some cases loss of data. For users who are testing
        out alpha or beta versions of Firefox, we offer the
        <a href="{{ acr_url }}">Add-on Compatibility Reporter</a> to help
        add-on developers update their compatibility.{% endtrans %}</dd>

        Add-ons are usually created by third-party developers from around the
        world, so the best way to get help with an add-on is to look for
        support links on the add-on's homepage or contact the developer. If you
        are having issues with {{ app_name }} that you suspect are related to
        add-ons you have installed, <a href="{{ troubleshooting_url }}">visit
