      <h3>How do I build an Add-on?</h3>
      <p>
        Mozilla provides documentation on how to build an add-on via the

        Extensions are packaged and distributed in ZIP files or Bundles, with

    <h3>{{ _('What is XUL?') }}</h3>
    <p>
      {% trans %}
        XUL (XML User Interface Language) is Mozilla's XML-based language
        that lets you build feature-rich cross platform applications. It
        provides user interface widgets like buttons, menus, toolbars,
        trees, etc that can be used to enhance add-ons by modifying parts
        of the browser UI.

      <strong>Note:</strong> XUL is considered a legacy technology in Firefox, and add-ons using XUL will no longer load starting from 
      Firefox 57. Please use <a href="{{ webext_url }}">WebExtensions</a> APIs to develop new add-ons. If you have a legacy add-on, 
      consider migrating it to WebExtensions. For information on migrating a legacy add-on, please visit

    <h3>{{ _('How do I test for compatibility with the latest version of Mozilla software?') }}</h3>
    <p>
      {% trans  %}
        To ensure compatibility with the latest Mozilla software, it's important
        to download updates as they become available and test your add-on to
        ensure that it is still functioning as expected. Since these releases at
        times introduce architectural changes that may impact the functionality of your
        add-on, it's important to be actively involved in the beta process to ensure
        that your add-on users are not negatively impacted upon final release of Mozilla software.

        host your add-on on <a href="{{ amo_url }}">Mozilla's add-on site</a>,
        though, allows for much greater exposure to your add-on due to the

    <p>
      {% trans %}
        The choice of category is dependent on what type of audience you are
        targeting and the functionality of your add-on. If you're unsure of
        which category your add-on falls into, please choose "Other". The AMO
        team may re-categorize your add-on if it's determined that it's
        better suited in a different category.

        add-ons to ensure a stable and safe experience for Mozilla users.
        When communicating with a reviewer, please be courteous, patient and
