        <div class="content"><p>Mozilla wants to know if having a Firefox experience tailored to the way you use the internet makes browsing the web more enjoyable. Participating in this study will help us find out!</p>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-next">What will happen next</h2>
<p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
<ol>
<li>We install <strong>Site Enhance</strong>, an add-on that will make the Firefox browser more personal to your usage patterns.</li>
<li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would. You may notice changes.</li>
<li>After 14 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
<li>We will ask you to fill out a quick <strong>optional survey</strong> to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="leaving-the-study">Leaving the study</h2>
<p>The study will expire on its own in 14 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <code>about:addons</code> into the location bar, and press enter.</li>
<li>Find <code>Site Enhance Shield Study</code> in the <strong>extensions</strong> list pane.</li>
<li>Click the <code>remove</code> button.</li>
<li>If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.</li>

<li>As you would expect, we do not collect any information when you are in private browsing mode.</li>
