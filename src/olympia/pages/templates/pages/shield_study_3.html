        <div class="content"><p>Mozilla wants to know if having a Firefox experience tailored to the way you use the internet makes browsing the web more enjoyable. Participating in this study will help us find out!</p>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-next">What will happen next</h2>
<p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
<ol>
<li>We install <strong>Firefox Guide</strong>, an add-on that will make the Firefox browser more personal to your usage patterns.</li>
<li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would. After a few days, you might see notifications about Firefox features.</li>
<li>After 30 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
<li>We will ask you to fill out a quick <strong>optional survey</strong> to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="leaving-the-study">Leaving the study</h2>
<p>The study will expire on its own in 30 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <code>about:addons</code> into the location bar, and press enter.</li>
<li>Find <code>Firefox Guide Study 1</code> in the <strong>extensions</strong> list pane.</li>
<li>Click the <code>remove</code> button.</li>
<li>If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.</li>
</ol>
<p>Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.</p>
<h2 id="your-privacy">Your privacy</h2>
<p>Our studies collect a basic set of data, such as your daily usage, information about when you install or uninstall the addon, and your responses to optional follow-up surveys.</p>
<p>In addition, here are the <strong>key things you should know</strong> about what is happening when you participate in this study:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We collect basic usage data</strong> about your interaction with the experimental add-on, such as how you interact with the recommendations we make.</li>
<li><strong>We collect data on what Firefox features you use</strong>, to provide a personalized Firefox experience. This includes your installed add-ons, preferences, and keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>We also recommend features to you based on popular websites you visit. <strong>Your browsing data remains on your computer</strong> and will not be collected on our servers.</li>
</ul>
