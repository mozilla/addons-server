          <p class="callout">Mozilla wants to better understand the health of the web, how users interact with it, and how people use their browsers.</p>
          <p><a href="https://medium.com/firefox-context-graph/context-graph-its-time-to-bring-context-back-to-the-web-a7542fe45cf3">We think that browsers could do so much more</a> through a better understanding of user behavior. By using the experience of people at human-scale, we can give you content that enriches your life. Pioneer will help us understand and build those experiences, but we can’t do it alone!</p>
          <p>In order to achieve this, we need to collect and analyze data about web browsing habits. We would like to identify a group of users willing to share this information with us. Data collection will happen in the background while you use Firefox, and your browser may occasionally change behavior slightly.</p>
          <p><strong>Participation in Firefox Pioneer is strictly voluntary.</strong></p>

          <h2 class="program-header">What Will Happen Next</h2>
          <p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A preference will change to note that you are willing to participate in Pioneer studies.  Continue using Firefox as you normally would.</li>
            <li>Periodically, we will enroll you in studies looking at some aspect of Firefox or the web in general. These studies will collect varying information about your browsing behavior, possibly including what web pages you visit and how you interact with them.</li>
            <li>Periodically, we may ask participants a yes/no question about what they are currently doing with the browser. As with all of Firefox Pioneer, choosing to answer these questions will be entirely optional.</li>

          <h2 class="program-header">Your Privacy</h2>
          <p>Mozilla understands the sensitivity of the data it may collect in some Pioneer studies and works hard to keep your data private and secure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We will not attempt to collect cookies, account names, passwords, email addresses, or POST form values.</li>
            <li>The <strong>data you submit is encrypted in Firefox</strong> and not decrypted until it is on a server that is not connected to the wider internet.</li>
            <li>This data will be linked to a randomly generated ID we only use for Firefox Pioneer. It is used to keep a specific user&#39;s data together on the server and helps us improve our analysis.</li>
            <li>No data will be collected from inside Private Browsing windows.</li>
            <li>Proposed studies will be reviewed by a panel consisting of privacy experts, internet researchers and web security engineers to ensure that the data being collected is appropriate and respects the user’s privacy.</li>
            <li>Individual data will never be shared publicly or sold. Only a small number of researchers will have access to raw data. If we share aggregate information from an studies, we will disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of participants being identified.</li>
          </ul>
