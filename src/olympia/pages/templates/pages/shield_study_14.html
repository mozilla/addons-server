<h2 id="what-will-happen-next">What will happen next</h2>
<p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
<ol>
<li>We will add additional functionality to improve your privacy with Firefox.</li>
<li>You will see a new browser icon that will allow you to report broken websites to Mozilla.</li>
<li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would..</li>
<li>When you see a broken site, use the browser icon to report it.</li>
<li>After 28 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
<li>We will ask you to fill out a quick <em>optional survey</em> to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="leaving-the-study">Leaving the study</h2>
<p>The study will expire on its own in 28 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the browser icon to report broken websites.</li>
  <li>Click "Disable Privacy Study"</li>
  <li>If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.</li>
</ol>
<p>Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.</p>

<h3 id="all-shield-studies">All Shield Studies</h3>
<p>Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.</p>
<p>This data is associated with <a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html">Firefox Telemetry collection</a>.</p>
<h3 id="this-particular-study">This Particular Study</h3>
<p>In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies and your voluntary answers to the followup survey, here are the <strong>key things you should know</strong> about what is happening when you participate in this study:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you choose to report a page as broken, we record the high-level domain name (e.g., mozilla.org) of the page that you report as broken.</li>
  <li>We also ask for additional information regarding how the reported webpage broke, other attributes of the page, and any additional comments.</li>
  <li>No personal information or data will be collected or recorded during the study, and we only receive information about sites you choose to report as broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more about the data collection for this study <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/shield-study-privacy/blob/master/docs/metrics.md">on our metrics document.</a></p>
