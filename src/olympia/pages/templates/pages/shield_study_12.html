        <div class="content"><p>Mozilla wants to know if we can make the new tab page more useful for finding and recovering sites you’ve visited in the past. Participating in this study will help us find out!</p>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-next">What will happen next</h2>
<p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
<ol>
<li>We will add additional functionality to the new tab page.</li>
<li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would. You may not notice any changes immediately.</li>
<li>After 14 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
<li>We will ask you to fill out a quick <em>optional survey</em> to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="leaving-the-study">Leaving the study</h2>
<p>The study will expire on its own in 14 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <code>about:addons</code> into the location bar, and press enter.</li>
<li>Find <code>New Tab Enhancement Shield Study</code> in the <strong>extensions</strong> list pane.</li>
<li>Click the <code>remove</code> button.</li>
<li>If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.</li>

<h3 id="all-shield-studies">All Shield Studies</h3>
<p>Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.</p>
<p>This data is associated with <a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html">Firefox Telemetry collection</a>.</p>
<h3 id="this-particular-study">This Particular Study</h3>
<p>In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies and your voluntary answers to the followup survey, here are the <strong>key things you should know</strong> about what is happening when you participate in this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect basic usage data regarding how you interact with the experimental new tab and timeline pages, such as the types of elements that you click and their position on the page. </li>
<li>We also collect basic information about your browser profile that affect the study, such as the number of bookmarks and history items.</li>
  <li>The newtab page could show recommendations by <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, part of the Mozilla family.  We collect which recommendations are shown, and which ones have been clicked.</li>
<li>As you would expect, we do not collect any information when you are in private browsing mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more about the data collection for this study <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/blob/master/docs/v1-test-pilot/data_events.md">on our Data Events document.</a></p>
