Hello,

Previously, your {{ type }} was suspended/removed from Mozilla Add-ons, based on a finding that you had violated Mozilla's policies.

After reviewing your appeal, we determined that it did not provide sufficient basis to overturn our earlier finding that your {{ type }} violates Mozilla's policies. {% if manual_reasoning_text %}{{ manual_reasoning_text }}. {% endif %}Based on that determination, we have denied your appeal, and will not reinstate your {{ type }}.
{% if is_addon_enabled %}If you submit a new version of this add-on (or have already done so), that version will be evaluated separately.{% endif %}

{% if has_attachment %}
An attachment was provided. {% if dev_url %}To respond or view the file, visit {{ dev_url }}.{% endif %}

{% endif %}
More information about Mozilla's add-on policies can be found at {{ policy_document_url }}.

Thank you.
