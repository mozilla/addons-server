    DRF authentication class for JWT header auth.

    This extends the django-rest-framework-jwt auth class to get the
    shared JWT secret from our APIKey database model. Each user (an add-on
    developer) can have one or more API keys. The JWT is issued with their
    public ID and is signed with their secret.

    **IMPORTANT**

    Please note that unlike typical JWT usage, this authenticator only
    signs and verifies that the user is who they say they are. It does
    not sign and verify the *entire request*. In other words, when you use
    this authentication method you cannot prove that the request was made
    by the authenticated user.
