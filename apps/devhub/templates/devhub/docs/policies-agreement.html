     <strong>Management of AMO Services.</strong>

     Mozilla may manage the AMO Services in a manner designed to facilitate the
     integrity and proper functioning of the AMO Services without limitation or
     liability. The following is a list of exemplary activities that Mozilla in
     its sole discretion may undertake as part of its management of the AMO
     Services: (i) monitor, test and review AMO Contributions; (ii) remove or
     disable AMO Contributions or change their listing or description; (iii)
     move an AMO Service and related AMO Contributions to a new domain or
     website; (iv) rate limit, throttle and/or block requests or access to any
     AMO Service; (v) use, modify or remove authentication requirements for
     access to AMO Services; and (vi) collect statistics and other data
     regarding your AMO Contribution, which may be made publicly available
     through the AMO API (as described below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>AMO <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.</strong>
      As part of the AMO Services, Mozilla provides the addons.mozilla.org API
      (&#8220;<strong>AMO API</strong>&#8221;), which allows you to get
      information about certain AMO Contributions distributed by Mozilla via the
      AMO Service and is currently served via calls to
      https://services.addons.mozilla.org/api/.
      You may use the AMO API solely to retrieve data made publicly available by
      Mozilla via the AMO API, which data may be used solely for your own
      reasonable business purposes or personal use. In addition to the
      restrictions otherwise set forth in the Terms regarding AMO Services
      generally, you agree that you are responsible for your use of and
      contribution to the AMO API and you will not:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        hide or mask from Mozilla the identity of your service as it uses the
        AMO API, including by failing to follow required identification
        conventions; or
      </li>
      <li>
        use the AMO API for any application that replicates or attempts to
        replicate the Mozilla AMO Service or experience
        unless your use of the AMO API is non-confusing. By non-confusing,
        Mozilla means that people should always know with whom they are dealing
        and where the information or software they are downloading came from.
        Websites and software that are not produced by Mozilla shouldn’t imply,
        either directly or by omission, that they are.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Firefox Sync Add-ons.</strong>
      If your AMO Contribution utilizes any Firefox Sync (formerly Weave) APIs
      or software, you agree (a) that you and your AMO Contribution will use
      the Firefox Sync APIs solely for their intended purpose; (b) that your
      AMO Contribution will not hide or mask its identity as it uses Mozilla’s
      hosted Firefox Sync services and/or Firefox Sync APIs, including by
      failing to follow required identification conventions; and (c) that
      you and your AMO Contribution will not use the Firefox Sync APIs for
      any application or service that replicates or attempts to replicate
      Mozilla’s hosted Firefox Sync services or experience unless such use
      is non-confusing. Your AMO Contribution shall not imply, either directly
      or by omission, that it is produced or endorsed by Mozilla.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Ownership, Reservation of Rights.</strong>

      You are welcome to use the AMO Services subject to these Terms, and
      Mozilla grants you the right to do so. Mozilla and its licensors reserve

      be deemed to grant you any right to use the trademarks, trade names,
      service marks, or trade dress of Mozilla or its licensors and Mozilla
      hereby reserves all right, title and interest therein. For information on

        warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and

        distributors will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental,
        consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in any way
        relating to the use of AMO Services and their collective liability
        under these Terms will not exceed $500 (five hundred dollars). Some
        jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages,
        so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Changes to the Terms.</strong>
      Mozilla may update these Terms as necessary from time to time. These Terms

      <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A.,
      excluding its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these Terms is
      held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in
      full force and effect. In the event of a conflict between a translated
      version of these Terms and the English language version, the English
      language version shall control. Mozilla’s subsidiaries and affiliates
      shall be third party beneficiaries of these Terms, entitled to enforce and
      rely upon the provisions hereof.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
