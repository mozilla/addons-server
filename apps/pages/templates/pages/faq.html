        Add-ons are small pieces of software that add new features or
        functionality to your installation of {{ app_name }}. Add-ons can
        augment {{ app_name }} with new features, foreign language
        dictionaries, or change its visual appearance. Through add-ons, you can
        customize {{ app_name }} to meet your needs and tastes.

        Add-ons listed in this gallery only work with Mozilla-based

        <a href="{{ getseamonkey_url }}">SeaMonkey</a>, and
        <a href="{{ getthunderbird_url }}">Thunderbird</a>. However, not all
        add-ons work with each of those applications or every version of those
        applications. Each add-on specifies which applications and versions it
        works with, such as Firefox 2.0 - 3.6.*. For Firefox add-ons, the
        install buttons will indicate whether the add-on is compatible or not.

            <a href="{{ sdk_url }}">Add-on SDK</a> or <a href="{{ bootstrap_url }}">bootstrapping</a>.

        Add-ons, unlike plugins, are automatically checked for updates once
        every day. In Firefox, updates are automatically installed by
        default. Versions of Firefox prior to 4 (and other applications) will alert
        you that updates to your add-ons are available.

        Unless clearly marked otherwise, add-ons available from this gallery
        have been checked and approved by Mozilla's team of editors and are
        safe to install. We recommend that you only install approved add-ons.
        If you wish to install unapproved add-ons or add-ons from third-party
        websites, use caution as these add-ons may harm your computer or
        violate your privacy. <a href="{{ learnmore_url }}">Learn more about

    {{ app_name }} slower?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>{% trans app_name=request.APP.pretty %}
        Most add-ons do not cause a perceivable performance decrease in
        {{ app_name }}, though installing an excessive number may have adverse
        effects. If you suspect an add-on is causing {{ app_name }} to be slow,
        try disabling it.{% endtrans %}</dd>

        If an add-on isn't compatible with your version of {{ app_name }}, it
        is usually either because your version of {{ app_name }} is outdated
        or the add-on author has not yet updated the add-on to be compatible
        with a newer version you are using. Mozilla does not recommend trying
        to circumvent these compatibility checks, as they can lead to browser
        instability or in some cases loss of data. For users who are testing
        out alpha or beta versions of Firefox, we offer the
        <a href="{{ acr_url }}">Add-on Compatibility Reporter</a> to help
        add-on developers update their compatibility.{% endtrans %}</dd>

        Add-ons are usually created by third-party developers from around the
        world, so the best way to get help with an add-on is to look for
        support links on the add-on's homepage or contact the developer. If you
        are having issues with {{ app_name }} that you suspect are related to
        add-ons you have installed, <a href="{{ troubleshooting_url }}">visit
