        It’s easy to help us make sure add-ons are updated in time for the
        release of the next version of Firefox.

          As you start browsing and using your add-ons, take careful note
          of anything that seems different from when you last used the
          extension. This might be a display glitch, such as a menu item
          missing, or something more serious, like the add-on not working
          at all or showing errors.
        {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
        {% trans %}
          Once you know whether a particular add-on works properly or has
          problems, open the Add-ons Manager and click Compatibility next
          to the add-on to let Mozilla know what you found in your testing.
          Submitting a report will help us tell the add-on developer
          whether their add-on is working properly in this version or might
          need some fixes.

        If you upgrade to a new version of Firefox or update your add-ons,
        your reports for the old versions will be hidden to allow you to test
        the new version. If you have any questions, please ask in
        <a href="{{ url }}">our forums</a>.

        Thousands of add-ons are made by our community every year, and your
        assistance with compatibility testing helps us make sure these add-ons
        stay useful as we strive to provide a great user experience.
