        You will need to have a version of the Mozilla software that you're

    <h3>{{ _('What is a ".xpi" file?') }}</h3>
    <p>

        Extensions are packaged and distributed in ZIP files or Bundles, with
        the XPI (pronounced "zippy") file extension.
      {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>{{ _('What is XUL?') }}</h3>
    <p>
      {% trans %}
        XUL (XML User Interface Language) is Mozilla's XML-based language
        that lets you build feature-rich cross platform applications. It
        provides user interface widgets like buttons, menus, toolbars,
        trees, etc that can be used to enhance add-ons by modifying parts
        of the browser UI.
      {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>{{ _('What is the "install.rdf" file used for?') }}</h3>
    <p>
      {% trans url='https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Install_Manifests' %}
        This file, called an <a href="{{ url }}">Install Manifest</a>,
        is used by Add-on Manager-enabled XUL applications to determine
        information about an add-on as it is being installed. It contains
        metadata identifying the add-on, providing information about who
        created it, where more information can be found about it, which
        versions of what applications it is compatible with, how it should
        be updated, and so on. The format of the Install Manifest is RDF/XML.
      {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>{{ _('What does "maxVersion" mean?') }}</h3>
    <p>
      {% trans %}
        This determines the maximum version of Firefox you're saying this
        extension will work with. Set this to be no newer than the newest
        currently available version!
      {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>{{ _('Can my add-on contain binary components?') }}</h3>
    <p>
      {% trans url='https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM' %}
        Yes. You can use Mozilla's <a href="{{ url }}">XPCOM component object model</a>
        to enhance your add-ons. XPCOM components be used and implemented in
        JavaScript, Java, and Python in addition to C++.
      {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>{{ _('Can I use a JavaScript library like jQuery, MooTools or Prototype to build my add-on?') }}</h3>
    <p>
      {% trans %}
        Yes. It's possible, but some of the functionality provided by these
        libraries are available through XPCOM, XUL, and JavaScript. In addition,
        authors should take care if libraries modify primitive object
        prototypes (String.prototype, Date.prototype, etc.) and/or define
        global functions (eg. the $ function). These are prone to cause
        conflict with other add-ons, in particular if different add-ons use
        different versions of libraries and so on. Developers need to be
        very, very careful with using them.  Mozilla does not offer
        documentation on using them to build add-ons.

        You can use the <a href="{{ url }}">Add-on Debugger</a>.
      {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>{{ _('How do I test for compatibility with the latest version of Mozilla software?') }}</h3>
    <p>
      {% trans  %}
        To ensure compatibility with the latest Mozilla software, it's important
        to download updates as they become available and test your add-on to
        ensure that it is still functioning as expected. In many cases, the latest
        version of Mozilla software may be a beta release. Since these releases at
        times introduce architectural changes that may impact the functionality of your
        add-on, it's important to be actively involved in the beta process to ensure
        that your add-on users are not negatively impacted upon final release of Mozilla software.
      {% endtrans %}

        Do you need more information about the various open source licenses? Are you
        confused as to which license you should select? What rights does a specific
        license grant? While nothing replaces reading the full terms of a license,
        below are some sites that contain information about some of the key open
        source licenses that may help you sort out the differences between them. These
        sites are being provided solely for your convenience and as a reference for

        Free Software Foundation provides short summaries of the key open
        source licenses, including whether the license qualifies as a free
        software license or a copyleft license.  Also includes a discussion
        of what constitutes a free software license or a copyleft license
        (e.g., a Copyleft license is a general method for making a program
        or other work free, and requiring all modified and extended versions
        of the program to be free as well.)
