"does, how a user should take advantage of it, and what the user should expect when they install it. Links to external documents for detailed instructions are fine, but the description itself should "
"cover the basics and leave users confident that they know what they'll get. Also, it is important that you maintain version notes appropriately as you improve and change your add-on. Users should "
