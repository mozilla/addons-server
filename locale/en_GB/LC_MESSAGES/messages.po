"<strong>Has the add-on been well-tested, and is it free of obvious or serious defects?</strong> One important thing that we look for when considering an add-on is whether its user reviews indicate "
"that it has received thorough testing, and that it doesn't have serious problems or negative impacts on the browser. If reviewers report problems such as major performance issues, crashes, frequent "
"problems using the functions of the add-on, or spamming of messages to the error console, you should take those reports to heart, and re-submit your add-on after you've addressed them as best you "
"can. We don't expect you to perfectly optimise or have zero bugs &mdash; Firefox itself undergoes constant improvement in these areas &mdash; but we do want you to take reasonable efforts to "
"minimise downsides, and to clearly call out cases where users may be surprised by those that remain."
