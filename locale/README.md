# Welcome to /locale/

## To Localizers:

The two files in your locale directories that are important are:

```
django.po
djangojs.po
```

Generally, legal documents are localized by lawyers and aren't in our gettext
process.  However, if you need to work with them, visit:

```
https://github.com/mozilla/zamboni/tree/master/media/docs
```

Also please make sure you're reading <mailto:dev-l10n-web@lists.mozilla.org>.  Thanks!

## To Developers:

Run the omg_new_l10n.sh script from your project root.  You should definitely
read that script to make sure you meet all of its expectations 'cause it makes
assumptions and doesn't have much error checking.

Ask clouserw if there are any questions.
